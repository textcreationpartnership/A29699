            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHriſtian Friendſhip makes ſuch a knot, that great<note place="margin">Its the ſaying of <hi>Euripides,</hi> that a faithful Friend is better than a calm Sea to a weather beaten Mariner.</note> 
               <hi>Alexander</hi> cannot cut. It was well obſerved by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> That old wood is beſt to burn, and old Books beſt to read, and old Friends beſt to truſt. It was a witty ſaying of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Monton,</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi> the III. his time, Faithful Friends (ſaith he) are in this age for the moſt part gone all in pilgrimage, &amp; their return is uncertain. They ſeem to take away the Sun out of the World (ſaid the Heathen Oratour) who take away friendſhip from the life of men, and we do not more need fire and water then true Friendſhip. In this Epiſtle I ſhall endeavour ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit my ſelf, as becomes a real Friend, a cordial Friend, a faithful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Friend, and a Soul-friend, as to your great and everlaſting concernments, that it may go well with you for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Sir, the points that are handled in this following
<pb facs="tcp:65138:3"/> Treatiſe (and in the firſt part) are of as high, choice, neceſſary, noble, uſeful and comfortable a nature, as any that can be treated on by mortal man. The four things which God minds moſt and loves moſt, are, 1. His ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 2. His worſhip. 3. His People. 4. His truth. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their ſouls muſt needs be of a very ſad complexion, who can read the great truths that are here opened and applyed, and not, 1. Dearly love them. 2. Highly prize them. 3. Cordially bleſs God for them. 4. Seriouſly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and meditate upon them. 5. And not frequently and diligently ſtudy them, and make a gracious and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improvement of them.</p>
            <p>The Covenant of Grace and the Covenant of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption are a rich Armory, out of which you may furniſh your ſelves with all ſorts of ſpiritual weapons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you may encounter Satans temptations, wiles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, methods, depths, ſtratagems. Nothing of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 2. 11. Revel. 2. 24.</note> can ſtand before the Covenant of Grace and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption, well underſtood and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
            <p>In the Covenant of Grace and the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 5. Iſa. 54. 9, 10. Jer. 32. 38, 39, 40, 41. Zach. 9. 11.

In times of afflictions. 2. In times of temptations. 3. In times of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion 4. In times of ſufferings for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpels ſake. 5. In times of oppoſition. 6. And at the time of death and diſſolution; There are no comforts nor cordials that can reach the ſouls of Chriſtians in their deep diſtreſſes, but ſuch as flow from theſe two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the more it concerns all ſuch Chriſtians to ſtudy theſe two Covenants, and to be well acquainted with them, that ſo they may the more readily have recourſe to ſuch cordials, as their preſent eſtate and condition calls for.</p>
            <p>In theſe two Covenants you will find much matter, which has a ſtrong tendency, 1. To inflame your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> love

To engage you to a cloſe and holy walking with God. 7. To provoke you to triumph in free grace, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 8. To ſit looſe from this world. The riches and Treaſures that are wrapt up in both theſe Covenants, are ſo great, ſo ſure, ſo durable, and ſo ſutable to all believers, as may well deaden their<note place="margin">Revt 12. 1.</note> hearts, to all the riches and glories of this lower world.</p>
            <p>In theſe two Covenants every ſincere Chriſtian will find, 1. A ſpecial ſalve for every ſpiritual ſore. 2. A ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial remedy againſt every ſpiritual malady. 3.

In theſe two Covenants you will find food to nouriſh you, a ſtaff to ſupport you, a guid to lead you, a fire to warm you, and ſprings of life to cheer and refreſh you.</p>
            <p>In this Covenant of Grace and the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,<note place="margin">'Twas the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saint on his Death-bed, that he had much peace, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not ſo much, from a greater meaſure of grace than other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had, or from any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat witneſs of the ſpirit, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he had a more clear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Covenant of Grace than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtudied it, and preacht it ſo many years as he had done.</note> you may clearly ſee the wiſdom, counſel, love and tranſactions between the Father and the Son ſparkling and ſhining, there being nothing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that contributes more to the peace, comfort, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſettlement and ſatisfaction of ſincere Chriſtians than ſuch a ſight, the main reaſon why ſo many gracious ſouls are ſo full of fears, doubts, darkneſs and diſputes about their internal and eternal eſtates, is becauſe they have no more clear and full underſtanding of theſe two Covenants; and if ſuch Chriſtians would but more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly buckle to the ſtudy of thoſe two covenants, as they are opened and applyed in the following Treatiſe, their fears and doubts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would quickly vaniſh, and they would have their triumphant ſongs, their mourning would ſoon be turned into rejoycing, &amp; their complaints into <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> Neither do I know any thing in all this world that would contribute more to ſeriouſneſs, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſs, heavenlyneſs, humbleneſs, holyneſs and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:65138:4"/> then a right underſtanding of theſe two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and a Divine improvement of them. There are many choice Chriſtians, who have alwayes either tears in their eyes, complaints in their mouths, or ſighs in their breaſts; and O, that theſe above all others would make theſe two Covenants their daily Companions! Let theſe few kinds ſuffice concerning the following Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir <hi>John,</hi> I ſhall crave leave to put you and your Lady a little, in mind of your deceaſed and glorified Father. He is a true Friend (ſaith the Smyrnean Poet of<note place="margin">Ponder upon that Deut. 13. 6. Thy friend which is as thine own ſoul.</note> old) who continueth the memory of his deceaſed Friend.

<pb facs="tcp:65138:10"/> when theſe agonies of conſcience are over, the ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his old courſes again, and often times is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold more a Child of Hell than before. There was a<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 15.</note> man in this City, who was given up to the higheſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes, on his ſick bed conſcience made an Arreſt of him, and he was filled with ſuch wonderful, horrour and terrour, that he cryed out day and night, that he was damned, he was damned, he was damned; and when he had ſome ſmall intervals, O what large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes did he make! what a new man, a reformed man he would be! but when in time his terrors and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought off, he was ſeven-fold worſe than before. Sometimes the awakened Sinner parts with ſome ſins, to make room for others; and ſometimes the Sinner ſeems to give a Bill of divorce to this ſin and that, but it is only becauſe his bodily ſtrength fails him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wants an opportunity, or becauſe there is a more ſtrict eye and watch upon him, or becauſe the ſword of the Magiſtrate is more ſharpned againſt him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">James 4. 3.</note> he wants fuel, he wants a purſe to bear it out, or becauſe ſome Company, or ſome Relations, or ſome Friends lye between him and his ſins, ſo that he muſt either tread over them, or elſe keep from his ſins; or becauſe he has deeply ſmarted for this ſin, and that his name has been blotted, his credit and reputation ſtained,<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 32, 33, 34, 35.</note> his Trade decayed, his health empaired, his body wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By theſe ſhort hints it is evident, that men may attain to ſome outward reformation, whoſe ſtates and hearts were never changed, and who were never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into marriage union with Chriſt.

Now this conſent is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a free and plain act of the will, accepting of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> before all others to be its Head and Lord, and in the ſouls choice of him to be its Saviour and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; Then a man is married to Chriſt, when he doth freely, and abſolutely, and preſently receive the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> not, I would have Chriſt if it did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice my worldly eſtate, eaſe, friends, relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or hereafter, I will accept of him when I come to dye, and be in diſtreſs, but now when ſalvation is offered, now while Chriſt tenders himſelf, I now yield up my heart and life unto him.

            <p>Thirdly, This marriage union with Chriſt includes and takes in an univerſal and perpetual conſent, for all time, and in all ſtates and conditions. There is (you know) a great difference between a wife and a ſtrumpet, a wife takes her husband upon all terms, to have, and to hold, for better and for worſe, for richer and for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, whereas a ſtrumpet is only for hire and luſt, when the purſe is emptied, or the body waſted and ſtrength conſumed the harlots love is at an end, ſo here: That acceptance and conſent which tyes the marriage knot between Chriſt and the ſoul, muſt be an unlimited and indefinite acceptance and conſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will take away thy Child: Chriſt, ſaith ſhe, is better to me than ten ſons. I will ſtrip thee, ſaith he, of all thy outward comfort: Yea, but Chriſt is mine, ſaith ſhe, and you cannot ſtrip me of him. Aſſurance that Chriſt was hers, and that he would go with her beyond the grave, bore her heart up above the threats<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34.</note> of being ſpoiled of all. When a great Lord had ſhewed a ſober, ſerious, knowing Chriſtian his Riches, his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely Habitation, his pleaſant Gardens, his delightful Walks, his rich Grounds, and his various ſorts of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the ſerious Chriſtian turning himſelf to this great Lord, ſaid: My Lord, you had need to make ſure Chriſt and Heaven, you had need make ſure ſomething, that will go with you beyond the grave, for elſe when you die you will be a very great loſer. O my Friends, I muſt tell you, it highly concerns you to make ſure ſomething that will go with you beyond the grave, or elſe you will be very great loſers, when you come to die. God having given you an abundance of the good things, and of the great things of this world, beyond what he has given to many thouſands of others. But</p>
            <p>The ſeventh word of advice and counſel is this, Look upon all the things of this world, and value all the things of this world now, as you will certainly look upon<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31.</note> them and value them when you come to lye upon a ſick bed, a dying bed; when a man is ſick in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and when death knocks at the door in good car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, O with what a diſdainful eye, with what a wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eye, with what a ſcornful eye does a man then look upon the honours, riches, dignities, and glories of this world! If men could but thus look upon them now, it
<pb facs="tcp:65138:15"/> would keep them from being fond of them, from truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, from doting upon them, from being proud of them, and from venturing a damning, either in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or in keeping of them. But</p>
            <p>The eight word of advice and counſel is this, In all places and companies carry your ſoul-preſervatives ſtill about you, <hi>viz.</hi> A holy care, a holy fear, a holy jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,<note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.

            <p>The ninth word of advice and counſel is this, Live not at uncertainties as to your ſpiritual and eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates;<note place="margin">See my Box of precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that Glaſs you may read the ſtate of your ſouls.</note> there are none ſo miſerable as thoſe that are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the ſtate of their own ſouls. It is good for a man to know the ſtate of his Flock, the ſtate of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the ſtate of the Nation, the ſtate of his Body; but above all to know the ſtate and condition of his own Soul. How many thouſands are there that can give a better account of their Lands, their Lordſhips, their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, their Crops, their Shops, their Trades, their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, yea of their Hawkes, their Hounds, their Miſſes, than they can of the eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But</p>
            <p>The tenth word of advice and counſel is this, Set the higheſt Scripture examples and patterns before you of grace and holineſs for your Imitation; In the point of<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 16.

Obſerve the gracious converſations and carriages of the choiceſt Saints, keep a fixed eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their wiſe, prudent, humble, holy, and heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; write after the faireſt copy you can find, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to imitate thoſe Chriſtians that are moſt eminent in grace.

            <p>The eleventh word of advice and counſel is this, Be much in the moſt Spiritual exerciſes of Religion: There are external excerciſes, ſuch as hearing, praying, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 11, 12, 13, 14. 1 Timoth. 4. 8.

But</p>
            <p>The twelfth and laſt word of advice and counſel I ſhall give you, is to make a wiſe, a ſeaſonable, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, a daily, and a through improvement of all the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents that God has entruſted you with. There is a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of time, of power, of riches, of honour, of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſome are more entruſted with than others are,
<pb facs="tcp:65138:17"/> the improvement of theſe is your great wiſdom, and ſhould be your daily works: You know you are but Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1, 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and that you muſt ſhortly give an account of your Steward-ſhip: And O that you may make ſuch a<note place="margin">Luke 16. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> faithful, and full improvement of all the great Talents that God has intruſted you with, that you may give up your account at laſt with joy and not with grief. Some Princes have wiſhed upon their beds that they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reigned, becauſe they have not improved their power for God and his People, but againſt God and his People; and ſome Rich men have wiſhed that they had never been rich, becauſe they have not improved their riches for the glory of God, nor for the ſuccour and relief of his ſuffering Saints. A Beggar upon the way asked ſomething of a honourable Lady; ſhe gave him ſix pence, ſaying: This is more than ever God gave me. O ſays the Beggar, Madam you have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and God hath given you all that you have, ſay not ſo good Madam. Well (ſays ſhe) I ſpeak the truth, for God hath not given but lent unto me what I have, that I may beſtow it upon ſuch as thou art: And it is very true indeed, that poor Chriſtians are Chriſts Alms-men, and the Rich are but his Stewards, into whoſe hands God hath put his monies, to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to them as their neceſſities require.

Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are a great bleſſing, but a heart to uſe them aright is a far greater bleſſing. Every Rich man is not ſo much a Treaſurer as a Steward, whoſe praiſe is more how to lay out well, than to have received much. I know I have tranſgreſſed the bounds of an Epiſtle, but love to

            <p>Sir, If you and your Lady were both my own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and my only Children, I could not give you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor more faithful counſel, than what I have given you in this Epiſtle, and all out of a ſincere, ſerious, and cordial deſire and deſign, that both of you may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py here, and found at Chriſts right hand in the great day of Account, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 33, 34.</p>

            <p>But when may a man ſafely and groundedly conclude that his cauſe is good, or that he ſuffers for well doing, or for a good cauſe, &amp; as a Chriſtian? Now, to this queſtion I ſhall give theſe following anſwers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When a man ſuffers for doing that which Chriſt commands, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> then he ſuffers for well doing, then he ſuffers as a Chriſtian, &amp; then<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 15, 16.</note> his cauſe is good. You know there is nothing in all the Scripture that God ſtands more upon than purity of religion, than purity of worſhip,<note place="margin">James 1. 27. Phil. 3. 3. Joh. 4. 23, 24.</note> than purity of ordinances, in oppoſition to all mixtures and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever. O ſirs, the great God ſtands upon nothing more in all the world, than upon purity in his worſhip. There is nothing that does<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 12, 13. Joh. 2. 15, 16, 17.</note> ſo provoke and exaſperate God againſt a people, as mixtures in his worſhip and ſervice; and no wonder, for mixtures in his worſhip are expreſly-croſs to his commands, and pollutions in worſhip do ſadly reflect upon the name of God, the honour of God, the truth of God; and therefore his heart riſes againſt them; defilements in worſhip do ſorely reflect upon the wiſdom of Chriſt &amp; the faithfulneſs of Chriſt, as if he were not faithful enough nor wiſe enough, nor prudent nor<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 4, 5, 6.</note> underſtanding enough, to order, direct and guide his people in the matters of his worſhip; but muſt be beholding to the wiſdom, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and care of man, of vain man, of ſinful man, of vile and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, to compleat, perfect and make up ſomething that was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his worſhip and ſervice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if a man ſuffers for owning pure worſhip and ordinances, for ſtanding for pure worſhip and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and for being found in the practice of pure worſhip and ordinances, his cauſe is good, and he ſuffers as a Chriſtian. But Secondly, When a man ſuffers for refuſing, or for not doing that which Chriſt condemns in his word, then his cauſe is good, and he ſuffers as a Chriſtian, for well doing. Now, in matters of Divine Worſhip, God condemns all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, all inventions and devices of men. The very ſpirit, life and ſoul of the Second Commandment lies in theſe words; <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any Graven Image.</hi> God abhors that men ſhould mix their Water with his Wine,<note place="margin">Levit. 10. 1, 2. Ezek. 5. 11, 12. cap. 23. 38, 39. Jer 7. 29, 30. Ezek. 8. 17, 18. Rev. 2. 22, 23. Deut. 4. 2. cap. 12 32. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> their Droſs with his Gold, their Chaff with his Wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When men will venture to be ſo hardy and bold with God, as to defile his Worſhip with their mixtures, then God is fully reſolved to be a ſwift and terrible witneſs againſt them, as you may clearly ſee by comparing thoſe notable places of Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Margin; there is no ſin that does ſo greatly incenſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to Jealouſie and Wrath againſt a People, as mixtures in his Worſhip. God can bear with defilements any where, rather than in Worſhip and Service. God did bear much, and bear long with the Jews

               </gap> when they had defiled and corrupted his worſhip, then God gave them a Bill of Divorce, and ſcattered them as Dung among the Nations. Now, when a man ſuffers for refuſing to worſhip God with a mixt worſhip, or with an invented or deviſed worſhip, which Chriſt in his word doth every where condemn; then his cauſe is good, and he ſuffers as a Chriſtian. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they that ſtoutly and reſolutely aſſert that the bleſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

            <p>That which bred the Popiſh Religion, Superſtition, Idolatry, and Pompous Worſhip, was men's departing from the word, and not cleaving to the word, as a ſufficient rule to direct them in all matters of worſhip; and what woful miſchiefs and miſeries have been brought upon the people of the Lord in this Land, and elſe where, by men that make not the word the rule of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but cry up an outward pompous worſhip, I have no mind to enumerate at this time: But how will theſe vain men that accuſe the holy Scriptures of inſufficiency, bluſh, be aſhamed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, when in the great day, the Lord ſhall plead the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and vindicate the Sufficiency and Authority of his bleſſed Book, in oppoſition to all the mixtures of men's Traditions with Divine Inſtitutions?

Now, whoever ſhall ſuffer for aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any of the precious Privileges, that are the Purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood; they ſuffer in a Righteous Cauſe, they ſuffer as Chriſtians, for well doing. And thus you ſee how a man may know when his Cauſe is good, juſt and righteous; and when he ſuffers as a Chriſtian, for well doing. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Conſider, That it is not enough for a man to have a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> good cauſe, but he muſt have a clear call; elſe he may be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferer, but no Martyr. Some may have a good Cauſe, and yet
<pb facs="tcp:65138:29"/> want a clear Call: Some may ſuffer for the cauſe of God, and yet ſin in ſuffering, for want of a Call.

When a man's Call is clear, his Peace will be ſweet, his courage will be high, and his comforts will be ſtrong, though his ſufferings be never ſo great, nor never ſo long. Though it be a high honour to ſuffer for the Goſpel, yet no man ought to take this honour upon himſelf but he that is called of God. Chriſtians muſt take as much heed how they eſpouſe a ſuffering ſtate, as how they ſhun a ſuffering ſtate: I am not to go to priſon upon choice, but upon a Call, but upon a Warrant under God's own hand; though it be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a gracious Spirit, to be always of a ready and forward mind to ſuffer for Chriſt: And when he demands who will go<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall I know when I am called to ſuffer, when I am called to lay down Life, Liberty and All, for the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt and the Goſpel? To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p>Firſt, When the Truth will ſufer, and the Name of God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and the Goſpel will ſuffer ſhould we decline ſuffering, then we are called to ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Secondly, When the caſe ſtands ſo with us, that we cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> keep Life, Eſtate, Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without denying of Chriſt or the Goſpel, or without concealing this precious Truth or that, or without turning our backs upon this Ordinance or that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then we are called to ſuffer when we cannot preſerve our Lives, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, our Eſtates, without denying of Chriſt, or the Concerns of Chriſt, in one degree or another, in one kind or another; then we are called to lay down our Lives, our Liberties, our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the feet of Chriſt, as the Saints and Martyrs of old have done before us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when our way is ſo hedged up with thorns, that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> muſt either ſin or ſuffer, when ſin and ſufferings ſurround us, ſo<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 6.</note> that we cannot get out or come off, but we muſt either ſin or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 17.</note> then I muſt, with the three Champions, chuſe rather to burn than to bow; and with <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Lyon's Den, than to omit my duty; and with <hi>Moſes,</hi> chuſe to ſuffer afflictions with<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 24, 25, 26</note> the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon.

               <hi>a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better:</hi> The Greek is very ſignificant; <hi>far, far the better,</hi> or far much better, or much more better; 'tis a moſt tranſcendent expreſſion: <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 1. Better is the day of death, than the day of ones birth.</hi> A Saint's dying day is the day-break of Eternal Righteouſneſs. In reſpect of pleaſure, peace, ſafety, company, glory, a Believer's dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day is his beſt day. I have read of one <hi>Trophonius,</hi> that when he had built and dedicated that ſtately Temple at <hi>Delphos,</hi> he asked of <hi>Apollo</hi> (for his recompence) that thing which was beſt for man: The Oracle wiſhed him to go home, and within three days he ſhould have it; and within that time he died. It was an excellent ſaying of one of the Ancients; That is not a death, but life, which joyns the dying man to Chriſt; and that is not a life, but death, which ſeparates a living man from Chriſt. But</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65138:37"/>
            <p>Secondly, Look upon Death as a remedy, as a cure; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Death will perfectly cure you of all corporal and ſpiritual<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimus morbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum medicus mors</note> diſeaſes at once; the crazy body and the defiled ſoul, the aking head and the unbelieving heart: Death will cure you of all your ails, aches, diſeaſes and diſtempers. At <hi>Stratford-bow</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, there was burnt<note place="margin">Act. and Mon. Fol. 1733.</note> a lame man and a blind man at one ſtake; the lame man, after he was chained, caſting away his crutch, bad the blind man be of good comfort; for death (ſaith he) will cure us both, thee of thy blindneſs, and me of my lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as Death will cure all your bodily diſeaſes, ſo it will cure all your ſoul diſtempers alſo: Death is not <hi>Mors hominis,</hi> but <hi>Mors peccati; not the death of the man,</hi> but <hi>the death of his ſin.</hi> Death will work ſuch a cure, as all your Duties, Graces, Experiences, Ordinances, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances, could never do; for it will at once free you fully, perfectly and perpetually from all ſin; yea, from all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ever ſinning more: Sin was the Midwife that<note place="margin">Pecc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i. Ambroſe de bono mortis, c. 4</note> brought death into the World, and death ſhall be the grave to bury ſin; and why then ſhould a Chriſtian be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to die, or unwilling to die, ſeeing Death gives him a Writ of eaſe from infirmities and weakneſſes, from all aches and pains, griefs and gripings, diſtempers and diſeaſes, both of body and ſoul: When <hi>Sampſon</hi> died, the Philiſtines alſo died together with him; ſo when a Saint dies, his ſins die with him: Death came in by ſin, and ſin goeth out by death; as the worm kills the worm that bred it, ſo death kills ſin that bred it. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Look upon death as a reſt, a full reſt; a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> dying day is his reſting day: It is a reſting day<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13. Job 3. 13, to 17. 2 Theſ. 1. 7. Micah 2. 10. Jer. 50. 6.</note> from ſin, ſorrow, afflictions, temptations, deſertions, diſſentions, vexations, oppoſitions and perſecutions. This world was never made to be the Saints reſt: Ariſe, for this is not your reſting place; they are like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, they can reſt no where but in the Ark, and in the Grave. <hi>In the grave</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) the weary are at reſt:</hi> Upon this very ground, ſome of the moſt refined Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have accounted Mortality to be a mercy, for they
<pb facs="tcp:65138:38"/> brought their friends into the World with mournful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies, but carried them out of the world with all joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſports and paſtimes, becauſe then they conceived they were at reſt, and out of Gun-ſhot. Death brings the Saints to a full-reſt, to a pleaſant reſt, to a matchleſs reſt, to an eternal reſt. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Look upon your dying day as a reaping <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> day. Now you ſhall reap the fruit of all the prayers<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 2. Gal. 6. 7, 8, 9. Iſa. 38. 3. Mat. 25. 31, to 41.</note> that ever you have made, and of all the tears that ever you have ſhed, and of all the ſighs and groans that ever you have fetched, and of all the good words that ever you have ſpoke, and of all the good works that ever you have done, and of all the great things that ever you have ſuffered: When Mortality ſhall put on Immortality,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11. 1. 6.</note> you ſhall then reap a plentiful Crop, a glorious Crop (as the fruit) of that good ſeed that for a time hath ſeemed to be buried and loſt. As Chriſt hath a tender heart, and a ſoft hand, ſo he hath an Iron memory; he punctually<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 24, 25.</note> remembers all the ſorrows, and all the ſervices, and all the ſufferings of his people, to reward them and crown them; <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Look upon your dying day as a gainful day, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> there is no gain to that which comes in by death; <hi>Phil</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 1. Phil. 1. 23.</note> 21. <hi>For me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain:</hi> A Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an gets more by death, than he doth by life; to be in Chriſt is very good, but to be with Chriſt is beſt of all. 'Twas a mighty bleſſing for Chriſt to be with <hi>Paul</hi> on earth, but 'twas the top of Bleſſings for <hi>Paul</hi> to be with Chriſt in heaven. Seriouſly conſider of a few things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That by death you ſhall gain incomparable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Crowns. 1. A Crown of Life, <hi>Rev. 2. 10. Jam.</hi> 1. 12. 2.

Death is a dark ſhort way, through which the Saints paſs to the Marriage-ſupper of the Lamb. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You ſhall gain a ſafe and honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> into that other world, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22. Oh, in what pomp and triumph did <hi>Lazarus</hi> ride to heaven on the wings of Angels!

Oh, what a ſudden change does death make! behold, he that even now was ſcorned by men, is all on a ſudden, carried by Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſom. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You ſhall gain a glorious welcome, a joyful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 4. 8, to 11. Luk. 15. 7, 10. Heb. 12. 23.</note> welcome, a wonderful welcome into heaven. By ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent of all Antiquity, the holy Angels and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity rejoyce at the ſinner's Converſion; but oh, what inexpreſſible, what tranſcendent joy is there, when a Saint is landed upon the Shore of Eternity? God and Chriſt, Angels and Arch-angels, all ſtand ready to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Believer as ſoon as his feet are upon the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of Glory. God the Father welcomes the Saints as his elect and choſen ones, Jeſus Chriſt welcomes them as
<pb facs="tcp:65138:39"/> his redeemed and purchaſed ones, and the Holy Spirit welcomes them as his ſanctified and renewed ones, and the Bleſſed Angels welcome them as thoſe they have<note place="margin">Heb. 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> guarded and attended on. When the Saints enter upon the Suburbs of Glory, the glorious Angels welcome them with harps in their hands, and ditties in their mouths. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You ſhall gain full freedom and liberty from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> all your enemies within and without, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin, Satan<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 70, 71, 74, 75.</note> and the World. 1. Death will free you from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling power of ſin: In heaven there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> as in hell there is nothing but wickedneſs, ſo in heaven there is nothing but holineſs. 2. Death will free<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> you from the power and prevalency of ſin: Here ſin plays the Tyrant, but in heaven there is no Tyranny, but perfect felicity. 3. Death will free you from all provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, temptations and ſuggeſtions to ſin. Now you ſhall be above all Satan's batteries. Now God will make<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 20.</note> good the promiſe of treading Satan under your feet: Some ſay Serpents will not live in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 8, 9. cap. 21. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> is caſt out, and ſhall be for ever kept out of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above. 4. Death will free you from all the effects and conſequents of ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> loſſes, croſſes, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, diſeaſes, diſgraces, ſufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the cauſe is taken away, the effect ceaſes; when the fountain of ſin is dried up, the ſtreams of afflictions, of ſufferings muſt be dryed up; the fuel being taken away, the fire will go out of it ſelf. Sin and ſorrow were born toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do live together, and ſhall die together. To open this fourth Particular a little more fully to you, conſider theſe four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That death will free you from all reproach and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ignominy on your names. Now <hi>Elijah</hi> is accounted the<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 17. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, Death will free you from all bodily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and diſeaſes; we carry about in our bodies the matter of a thouſand deaths, and may die a thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral<note place="margin">Above all things let us every day think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

The Saints of God do but ſleep when they lay down in the Grave; that which we call death (in ſuch) is not death indeed, it is but the image of death, the Shadow and Metaphor of death, death's younger Brother, a mere ſleep, and no more.

            <p>Eighthly and laſtly, Look upon death as a going to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Bed. The Grave is a Bed wherein the body is laid to reſt, with its curtains cloſe drawn about it, that it may not be diſturbed in its repoſe: So the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to phraſe it; <hi>He ſhall enter into peace, they ſhall reſt in their beds, every one walking in their uprightneſs.</hi>

Death is nothing elſe, but a Writ of eaſe to the weary Saints; 'tis a total ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all their labour of nature, ſin and affliction: <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, that they may reſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> 
               <hi>from their labours,</hi> &amp;c. Whilſt the ſouls of the Saints do reſt in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom, their bodies do ſweetly ſleep in their beds of duſt, as in a ſafe and conſecrated Dormitory. Every ſincere Chriſtian may, like the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:65138:41"/> child, call and cry to be laid to bed; knowing that death will ſend him to his everlaſting reſt. Now you ſhould always look upon death under Scripture Notions, and this will take off the terrour of death; yea, it will make the King of Terrours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be the King of deſires; it will make you not only willing to die, but even long to die, and to cry out, <hi>O that I had the wings of a dove, to fly away, and be at reſt.</hi> At death you ſhall have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and be freed from all incumbrances.

It was well ſaid of one, ſo far as we tremble at death, ſo far we want love; it's ſad when the contract is made between Chriſt and a Chriſtian, to ſee a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an afraid of the making up the Marriage.

The Turks tell us that ſurely Chriſtians do not believe heaven to be ſuch a glorious place as they talk of; for if they did, they would not be ſo unwilling to go thither. The world may well think that the Child hath but cold welcom at his Father's houſe, that he lingers ſo much by the way, and that he does not look and long to be at home: Such Children bring an ill report upon their Father's Houſe, upon the Holy Land; but I know you have not ſo learned Chriſt, I know you long with <hi>Paul; to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt;</hi> and<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> with old <hi>Simeon,</hi> to cry out, <hi>Lord let thy ſervant depart</hi>

               <hi>Sinai:</hi> Thus you ſee, that God has commonly dealth with man in the way of a Covenant. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, premiſe this with me, All men are under <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſome Covenant or other; they are either under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, or they are under a Covenant of grace: all perſons that live and die without an intereſt in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they live and die under a Covenant of works; ſuch as live and die with an intereſt in Chriſt, they live and die under a Covenant of grace. There is but a two-fold ſtanding taken notice of in the bleſſed Scriptures; the one<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. I am not of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi>'s mind, that there were three Covenants; but of the Apoſtles mind, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly tells us, that there are two Teſtaments, and no more, in that <hi>Gal. 4. 24.</hi>
               </note> is under the Law, the other is under Grace. Now, he that is not under grace, is under the Law. It is true, in the Scripture you do not read, <hi>in totidem ſyllabis,</hi> of the Covenant of works, and the Covenant of grace: but that of the Apoſtle, comes near it, <hi>Rom. 3. 27. where is boaſting then? it is excluded; by what Law? of works? nay, but by the Law of faith:</hi> Here you have the Law of works, oppoſed to the Law of faith; which holds out as much as the Covenant of works, and the Covenant of grace. The Apoſtle ſets forth this two-fold condition of men, by a very pertinent reſemblance, namely, by that of marriage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3. All <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſeed are marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one of theſe two husbands; either to the Law, or to Chriſt. He that is not ſpiritually married to Chriſt, and ſo brought under his Covenant, is ſtill under the Law, as a Covenant of works; even as a wife is under the Law of her husband, while he is yet alive. Certainly, there were never any, but two Covenants made with man, the one Legal, the other Evangelical; the one of works, the other of grace; the firſt in innocency, the other after the fall: ponder upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let me premiſe this, That the Covenant of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> grace was ſo legally diſpenſed to the Jews, that it ſeems to be nothing elſe, but the repetition of the Covenant of works; in reſpect of which legal diſpenſations of it, the ſame Covenant, under the Law, is called a Covenant of works; under the Goſpel, in regard of the clearer manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65138:43"/> of it, it is called a Covenant of grace: But theſe were not two diſtinct Covenants, but one and the ſame Covenant diverſly diſpenſed. The Covenant of grace is the ſame for ſubſtance now to us, ſince Chriſt was exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, as it was to the Jews, before he was exhibited; but the manner of adminiſtration of it is different, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is: 1. Now clearer, things were declared then in types and ſhadows; Heaven was then typed out by the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but now we have things more plainly<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 12. Heb. 7. 12.</note> manifeſted. In this reſpect it is called a better Teſtament or Covenant; not in ſubſtance, but in the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiling it; and the promiſes are ſaid to be better promiſes<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6. Act. 10. 35.</note> upon the ſame account. 2. The Covenant of grace, is now more largely extended; then it extended only to the Jews, but now, to all that know the Lord, and that<note place="margin">Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is more abundance of the ſpirit, of grace, of light, of knowledg, of holineſs, poured out general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> upon the people of God now, than there was in thoſe<note place="margin">The word Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tongue, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, as we all know, a mutual promiſe, bargain and obligation, between two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Berith,</hi> and the Greek <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theke.</hi> A Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is a ſolemn compact or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen parties, or more; whereby, with mutual, free and full conſent; they bind and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige themſelves, one to another.

But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, premiſe this with me, that a right notion of the Covenant, according to the Originals of the Old and New Teſtament, will conduce much to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of God's Covenant. The derivation of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word, and of the Greek, may give us great light and is of ſpecial uſe, to ſhew the nature of the Covenant which they principally ſignifie, and what ſpecial things are therein required: The Hebrew word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Berith, a Covenant,</hi> is by learned men, derived from ſeveral roots: Firſt, ſome derive it from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Barar,</hi> to purifie, make clear, and to purge out droſs, chaff, and all uncleanneſs; and to ſelect, and chuſe out, and ſeparate the pure from the impure, the gold and ſilver from the droſs, and the pure wheat from the chaff. The reaſons of this derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65138:44"/> are theſe two: 1. Becauſe, by Covenants open and clear amity is confirmed, and faithfulneſs is plainly and clearly declared and ratified without deceipt or ſophiſtication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt covenanters: And things are made plain and clear betwixt them, in every point and article: 2. Becauſe God, in the Covenant of works, did chuſe out man eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, with whom he made the Covenant; and becauſe, in the Covenant of grace, he chuſeth out of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude his Elect, even his Church and faithful people, whom he did ſeparate by predeſtination and election from all Eternity, to be an holy people to himſelf in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. 2. Some derive it from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, And verily, the Lord, when he makes a Covenant with any, he doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from others, he looks on them, and takes them, and owns them for his <hi>peculiar people, 1 Pet. 2. 9. for his peculiar treaſure,</hi> Exod. 19. 5. and agrees with them, as the choſen and choiceſt of all others,: The firſt ſtaff in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 10. is called <hi>Beauty,</hi> and this was the Covenant; and certainly it muſt be a high honour for a people to be in Covenant with God; for by this means, God becomes ours, and we are made nigh unto him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 38, 40, 41. He is ours, and we are his, in a very peculiar way of relation: and by this means, God opens his love, and all his treaſures of grace unto us: In his Covenant he tells us of his ſpecial care, love, kindneſs, and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of good to us; and by this means his faithfulneſs comes to be obliged to make good all his Covenant relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and engagements to us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 9. Now in all this, God puts a great favour and honour upon his people. Hence, when the Lord told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would make<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>Barah, comedit, to eat,</hi> becauſe uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had a feaſt at the making of Covenants; in the Eaſtern Countreys they commonly eſtabliſhed their Cove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nants, by cating and dringing together. <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us, that the Perſians were wont to contract Leagues and friendſhip, <hi>inter vinum &amp; epulas,</hi> in a ful feaſt, where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65138:44"/> whereat their wives, children and friends were preſent. The like <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports of the Germans amongſt the Greeks and other nations, the Covenanters ate bread and ſalt together. The Emperour of <hi>Ruſſiah,</hi> at this day, when he would ſhew extraordinary grace and favour unto any, ſends him bread and ſalt from his table: And when he invited Baron <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Ambaſſador, he did it in this form; Sigiſmunde, <hi>come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſal &amp; panem noſtrum nobiſcum:</hi> Sigiſmond, <hi>you ſhall eat our bread and ſalt with us.</hi> Hence, that Symbol of <hi>Pythagoras, <gap reason="foreign">

Now this Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Diatheke,</hi> is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Diati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themai,</hi> which hath divers of the ſignifications of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew words, of which <hi>Berith</hi> is derived; for it ſignifies to ſet things in order and frame, to appoint orders, and make Laws, to pacifie and make ſatisfaction, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe things by ones laſt Will and Teſtament. Now, to compoſe and ſet things in order, is to uphold the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to walk by orders and Laws made and appointed, is to walk by rule, and to live, to deal plainly and faithfully without deceipt. To pacifie and make ſatisfaction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes ſacrifices and ſin-offerings: To diſpoſe by will and Teſtament, implies choice of perſons and gifts; for men do commonly by will, give their beſt and moſt choice things, to their moſt dear, and moſt choice friends. Thus the Greek which the Apoſtles uſe in the New Teſtament, to ſignifie a Covenant, to expreſs the Hebrew word <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith,</hi> which is uſed in the Law and the Prophets, doth confirm our derivation of it, from all the words before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named. And this Derivation of the Hebrew and Greek names of a Covenant being thus laid down, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reaſons formerly cited, is of great uſe. The various acceptation and uſe of theſe two names in the Old and New Teſtament, is very conſiderable for the opening of the Covenant. Firſt, to ſhew unto us, the full ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word Covenant, and what the nature of a Covenant is in general: 2. To juſtifie the divers accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word, and to ſhew the nature of every word in particular; and ſo to make way for the knowledg of the agreement and difference between the Old and New Covenant: here, as in a Chriſtal glaſs, you may ſee that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65138:47"/> this word <hi>Berith,</hi> and this word <hi>Diatheke,</hi> ſignifie all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants in general, whether they are religious or civil; for there is nothing in any true Covenant, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in the ſignification of theſe words, being expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the former derivations. Here alſo, we may ſee what is the nature of a Covenant in general, and what things are thereunto required: As firſt, every true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant preſuppoſeth a diviſion or ſeparation: Secondly, it comprehends in it a mutual promiſing and binding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two diſtinct parties: Thirdly, there muſt be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dealing, without fraud, or diſſembling on both ſides: Fourthly, this muſt be between choice perſons: Fifthly, it muſt be about choice matters, and upon choice condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, agreed upon by both: Sixthly and laſtly, it muſt tend to the well ordering and compoſing of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Now, all theſe are manifeſt by the ſeveral ſignifications of the words, from which <hi>Berith</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theke,</hi> are derived. And thus much for the word Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, according to the Originals of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, premiſe this with me, That there was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, or reciprocal Covenant, betwixt God and <hi>Adam,</hi> together with all his poſterity: Before <hi>Adam</hi> fell from his primitive holineſs, beauty, glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; God made a Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> as a publick perſon, which repreſented all Mankind. The Covenant of works was made with all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> who was made, and ſtood as a publick perſon, head and root, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and comprehenſive capacity: I ſay, it was made with him as ſuch, and we all in him; he and all ſtood and fell together: 1.

The end of this Covenant, was the upholding of the Creation, and of all the creatures, in their pure natural eſtate, for the comfort of man con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually, and for the ſpecial manifeſtation of God's free grace: And that he might put the greater obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Adam,</hi> to obey his Creator, and to ſweeten his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to man; and that he might draw out <hi>Adam</hi> to an ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>erciſe of his faith, love and hope in his Creator; and that he might leave <hi>Adam</hi> the more inexcuſable in caſe he ſhould ſin; and that ſo, a clear way might be made for God's ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and man's conviction: Upon theſe grounds God dealt with <hi>Adam,</hi> not only in a way of ſovereignty, but in a way of Covenant.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65138:48"/> expreſſed; and this I ſhall make evident by an induction of particulars, thus;</p>
            <p>Firſt, God, to declare his ſovereignty and man's ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, gave <hi>Adam,</hi> though innocent, a Law. God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs preſcription of a poſitive Law, unto <hi>Adam,</hi> in his innocent ſtate, is clearly and fully laid down, in that <hi>Gen. 2. 16, 17. And the Lord God commanded the man, ſaying, of every tree of the garden thou maiſt freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledg of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> Hebrew, <hi>Dying, thou ſhalt die.</hi> Mark how God bounds man's obedience with a double fence: Firſt, he fenced him with a free indulgence, to eat of every tree in the Garden, but one; the leſs cauſe he had to be liquoriſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forbidden fruit; but, <hi>ſtolen waters are ſweet.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by an exploratory prohibition upon pain of death: by the firſt, the Lord wooes him by love; by the ſecond, he frights him by the terrour of his juſtice; and bids him touch and taſte, if he durſt. The <hi>Faederati</hi> were God and <hi>Adam;</hi> God the Creator, and man the creature, made <hi>after Gods image and likeneſs;</hi> and ſo not contrary to God, nor at enmity with him, but like unto God, though far different and inferiour to God in nature and ſubſtance. Here are alſo terms agreed on, and matters covenanted reciprocally, by theſe parties: <hi>Adam,</hi> on his part, was to be obedient to God, in forbearing to eat of the tree of knowledg only. God's charge to our firſt parents was only negative, not to eat of the tree of knowledg; the other, to eat of the trees, was left unto their choice. <hi>Eve</hi> confeſſeth that God ſpake unto them both, and ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall not eat of it:</hi> And God ſpeaks unto both of them<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 2.</note> together in theſe words; <hi>Behold I have given unto you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>herb, and every tree,</hi> &amp;c. At which time, alſo, it is very like, that he gave them the other prohibition of not eating of that one tree; for if God had made that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception before, he would not have given a general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion after; or if this general grant had gone before, the exception coming, ſhould ſeem to abrogate the former
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65138:48"/> grant. The Septuagint ſeem to be of this mind, that this precept was given both to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> reading thus<note place="margin">So doth <hi>Gregory</hi> read as the Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint does, <hi>Gr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was the more principal, and he had the charge of the woman: And 2. Becauſe that the greateſt danger was in his tranſgreſſion, which was the cauſe of the ruine of his poſterity: 3.

And God, on his part, for the preſent, permits <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of all other trees of the Garden. And for the future (in his explicite threatning of death in caſe of diſobedience) implicity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth life, in caſe of obedience herein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the promiſes of this Covenant on God's part, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> were very glorious; Firſt, that heaven, and earth, and all creatures, ſhould continue in their natural courſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, wherein God had had created and placed them, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always for man's uſe, and that man ſhould have the benefit and Lordſhip of them all.

               </gap> ſin that bred it. Now, where there are parties covenanting, promiſing, and agreeing upon terms, and terms mutually agreed upon by thoſe parties,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65138:49"/> as here. There's the ſubſtance of an expreſs Covenant, though it be not formally, and in expreſs words called a Covenant. This was the firſt Covenant which God made with man, and this is called by the name <hi>Berith, Jer.</hi> 33. 20. where God ſaith, <hi>If you can break my Covenant of the day and night, and that there ſhall not be day and night in their ſeaſon,</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>Then may alſo my Covenant with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, be broken.</hi> In theſe words he ſpeaks plainly of the promiſe in the Creation: That day and night ſhould keep<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 14, 15, 16.</note> their courſe, and the ſun, moon, and ſtars, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould ſerve for man's uſe. Now, though man did break the Covenant on his part, yet God being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, could not break Covenant on his part, neither did he ſuffer his promiſe to fail; but by vertue of Chriſt promiſed to man in the new Covenant, he will keep touch with man ſo long as mankind hath a being on the earth, In this firſt Covenant, God promiſed unto man life and happineſs, Lordſhip over all the creatures, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to uſe them, and all other bleſſings which his heart could deſire, to keep him in that happy eſtate, wherein he was created. And man was bound to God, to walk in perfect righteouſneſs, to obſerve and keep God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and to obey his will in all things, which were within the reach of his nature, and ſo far as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled to him: In the firſt Covenant, God reveiled himſelf to man, as one God, Creator and Governour of all things, infinite in power, wiſdom, goodneſs, nature and ſubſtance. God was man's good Lord, and man was God's good ſervant; God dearly loved man, and man greatly loved God with all his heart; there was not the leaſt ſhadow, or occaſion of hatred or enmity between them; there was nothing but mutual love, mutual delight, mutual content, and mutual ſatisfaction, between God and man: Man, in his primitive glory, needed no Mediator, to come between God and him; man was perfect, pure, upright and good, created after God's own image; and the nearer he came to God, the greater was his joy and comfort: God's preſence now, was man's great delight;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65138:49"/> and it was man's heaven on earth, to walk with God. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider the intention and uſe of the two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Trees in the Garden, that are mentioned in a more peculiar manner, <hi>viz. The tree of life,</hi> and <hi>The tree of knowledg.</hi> The intended uſe of theſe two Trees in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, was <hi>Sacramental:</hi> Hence they are called <hi>Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Trees, and <hi>Sacramental</hi> Trees, by learned writers, both ancient and modern. By theſe the Lord did ſignifie and ſeal to our firſt parents, that they ſhould always enjoy that happy ſtate of life, in which they were made, upon condition of obedience to his Commandments, <hi>i. e.</hi> in<note place="margin">The Tree of life was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>eal which God gave to man, for confirmation of this firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and it was to man, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pledge of eternal life on earth, and of all bleſſings needful to keep man in life.</note> 
               <hi>eating of the tree of life, and not eating of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</hi> The Tree of life is ſo called, not becauſe of any native property, and peculiar vertue it had in it ſelf, to convey life; but <hi>ſymbolically, morally</hi> and <hi>ſacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> It was a ſign and obſignation to them of life, natural and ſpiritual, to be continued to them, as long as they continued in obedience to God. The ſeal of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venant was the <hi>Tree of life;</hi> which, if <hi>Adam</hi> had receiv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, by taking and eating of it, whilſt he ſtood in the ſtate of Innocency, before his fall, he had certainly been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in that eſtate for ever; and the Covenant being ſealed and confirmed between God and him on both parts, he could not have been ſeduced and ſupplanted by Satan, as ſome learned men do think, and as God's own words ſeem to imply, <hi>Gen. 3. 22. And now, leſt he put forth his hand, and take alſo of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. The tree of knowledg of good and evil,</hi> was ſpoken from the ſad event and experience they had of it, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> had of God's departing from him, when he loſt his Nazaritiſh hair by <hi>Dalilah. The tree of life,</hi> was a Sacrament of life; <hi>The tree of knowledg,</hi> a Sacrament of death: <hi>The tree of life,</hi> was for confirmation of man's obedience; and <hi>The tree of knowledg,</hi> was for caution againſt diſobedience. Now if theſe two Trees were two Sacraments; the one aſſuring of lite in caſe of obedience, the other aſſuring of death in caſe of diſobedience; then hence we may collect,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65138:50"/> That God not only entred into a Covenant of works with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo gave him this Covenant under Sacramental ſigns and ſcals. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Seriouſly conſider that a Covenant of works <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> lay clear, in that Commandment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. which may thus be made evident; 1. Becauſe that was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man's ſtanding and life, as it was expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: 2. Becauſe, in the breach of that Commandment given him, he loſt all, and we in him. God made the Covenant of works primarily with <hi>Adam,</hi> and with us in him, as our head, incluſively; ſo that when he did fall, we did fall; when he loſt all, we loſt all. There are five things we loſt in our fall; 1. Our holy Image, and ſo became vile: 2. Our ſonſhip, and ſo became ſlaves: 3. Our friendſhip, and ſo became enemies: 4. Our com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion with God, and ſo became ſtrangers: 5. Our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo became miſerable.

               </note> and in <hi>Adam</hi>'s dying, we all died; as you may ſee, by comparing the Scriptures in the margent together. In <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt ſin, we all became ſinners by imputation: <hi>Adam</hi> being an univerſal perſon, and all mankind one in him, by God's Covenant of works with him: <hi>Omnes il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le unus homo fuerunt,</hi> Auguſt. <hi>All were that one man,</hi> viz. by federal conſociation: God covenanted with <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with all his poſterity; and therefore <hi>Adam</hi>'s breach of Covenant, fell not only upon him, but upon all his poſterity. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, we read of a <hi>Second Covenant, Heb.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah:</hi> So Heb. 8. 8. <hi>I will make a new covenant,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 13. <hi>In that he ſaith a new covenant, he hath made the firſt old,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 12. 24. <hi>And to Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant,</hi> &amp;c. Now if there be a <hi>Second Covenant,</hi> then we may ſafely conclude there was a <hi>Firſt;</hi> and if there be a <hi>New Covenant,</hi> then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65138:50"/> we may boldly conclude that there was an <hi>Old Covenant:</hi> A Covenant of Grace always ſuppoſeth a Covenant of Works: I know there is a repetition of the Covenant of Works with <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> as in that of<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 7, 8, 9.</note> the Apoſtle to the Galatians, <hi>The Law is not of faith, but the man that doth theſe things, ſhall live in them.</hi> The Law requires works, and promiſeth no life to thoſe that will be juſtified by faith. In the firſt Covenant, three<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10, 11, 12.</note> things are obſervable; 1. The precept, <hi>That continueth not in all things;</hi> the precept requires perfect, perſonal and perpetual obedience: 2. The promiſe, <hi>Live, the man that doth them ſhall live;</hi> live happily, bleſſedly, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, everlaſtingly: 3. The curſe in caſe of tranſgreſſion, <hi>Curſed is every one, that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them:</hi> One ſin, and that but in thought, broke the Angel's Covenant,<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> and hath brought them into everlaſting chains: So the ſame Apoſtle, to the Romans, further tells us, that <hi>Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the law, that the man that doth thoſe things, ſhall live by them.</hi> Thus it was<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 5.</note> with <hi>Adam,</hi> principally and properly, therefore he was under a Covenant of works, when God gave him that command, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. This firſt Covenant, is called a Covenant of works, becauſe this Covenant required working on our part, as the condition of it, for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and happineſs, <hi>The man that doth theſe things, ſhall live.</hi> Under this Covenant, God left man to ſtand upon his own bottom, and to live upon his own ſtock, and by his own induſtry; God made him perfect and upright, and gave him power and ability to ſtand, and laid no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity at all upon him to fall. In this firſt Covenant of works, man had no need of a Mediator, God did then ſtipulate with <hi>Adam</hi> immediately; for ſeeing he had not made God his enemy by ſin, he needed no days-man, to<note place="margin">Job 9. 33.</note> Make friendly interceſſion for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was inveſted and endowed with righteouſneſs and holineſs in his firſt glorious eſtate; with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he might carry it fairly, juſtly, evenly and

                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. In this Scripture, the Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly of the Renovation of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that <hi>Adam</hi> ſometimes had, but loſt it by his fall.</note> might carry it wiſely, lovingly, reverentially and holily towards God, and that he might take up in God as his chiefeſt good, as in his great ALL. I ſhall not now ſtand upon the diſcovery of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Beauty, Authority, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, Dignity, Honour and Glory, with which he was adorned, inveſted and crowned in innocency: Let this ſatisfie, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt eſtate, was a ſtate of perfect<note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 4, 5, 6.

            <p>Firſt, Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the mediator of this Covenant,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Heb. 9. 15. And for this cauſe, he is the mediator of the new teſtament, that by means of death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt teſtament; they which are called, might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance:</hi> Certainly, that Covenant, of which Chriſt is the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, muſt needs be a Covenant made with us: for elſe, if the Covenant were made only with Chriſt (as ſome would have it) then it will roundly follow, that Jeſus Chriſt is both Teſtator; and the party, to whom the Teſtaments and Legacies are bequeathed: which ſounds harſh; yea, which, to aſſert, is very abſurd: Since the creation of the world, was it ever known, that ever any man did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath a Teſtament and Legacies to himſelf? Surely no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt is the Teſtator of the New Covenant; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may ſafely conclude, that the New Covenant is made with us. The office of Mediator (you know) is to ſtand betwixt two at variance: The two at variance, were God and man: Man had offended and incenſed God againſt him; God's wrath was an inſupportable burrhen, and a conſuming fire; no creature was able to ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, or before it: Therefore Chriſt, to reſcue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem man, becomes a Mediator; Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> undertaking to be a Mediator, both procured a Covenant to paſs betwixt God
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65138:52"/> and man, and alſo engaged himſelf for the performance thereof on both parts; and to aſſure man of partaking of the benefit of God's Covenant, Chriſt turns the Covenant into a Teſtament; that the conditions of the Covenant, on God's part, might be as ſo many Legacies; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed by the death of the Teſtator, none might diſannul, <hi>Heb. 8. 6. He is the mediator of a better covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi> The promiſes of the new Covenant are ſaid to be better in theſe ſix reſpects, 1. All the promiſes of the Law, were conditional: <hi>Do this, and thou ſhalt live;</hi> the promiſes of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are abſolute of grace, as well as to grace: 2. In this better Covenant, God promiſeth higher things; here God promiſeth himſelf, his ſon, his ſpirit, a higher righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a higher ſonſhip: 3. Becauſe of their ſtability, thoſe of the old Covenant, were <hi>ſwallowed up in the curſe;</hi>

            <p>They that are under this Covenant of works, muſt of neceſſity periſh.

            <p>Secondly, Such as are under a Covenant of works, their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> beſt and choiceſt duties are rejected and abhorred, for the leaſt miſcarriages or blemiſhes, that do attend them, or cleave to them: Obſerve the dreadful language of that Covenant of works; <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all</hi>

His word cannot be made more true, but yet it may be made more credible: Now two things make a thing more credible; 1. The quality of the perſon-ſpeaking: 2. The manner of the ſpeech; If God doth not ſimply ſpeak, but ſolemnly ſwear, we have the higheſt cauſe imaginable, to reſt aſſured, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfied in the word and oath of God: An oath amongſt men, is the ſtrongeſt, ſureſt, moſt ſacred and inviolable bond; <hi>For men verily ſwear by the greater,</hi>

Ah my friends, hath God ſaid it, and will he not do it? Yea, hath he ſworn it, and will he not bring it to paſs? Dare we truſt an honeſt man, upon his bare word, much more upon his Oath; and ſhall we not much more truſt a holy, wiſe and faithful God, upon his word, upon his Covenant, when confirmed by an oath. The Covenant of Grace is ſure in it ſelf, it is a firm Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, an unalterable Covenant, an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a ratified Covenant; ſo that heaven and earth may

Now, if you caſt your eye aright, you ſhall ſee, that the Covenant of Grace flows from theſe three ſprings.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the free grace and favour of God: There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was nothing in fallen man, to invite God to enter into Covenant with him; yea, there was every thing in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man, that might juſtly provoke God to abandon man, to abhor man, to revenge himſelf upon man. It was mere grace that made the Covenant, and it is mere grace that makes good the Covenant: Now that which ſprings from mere grace, muſt needs be inexceptionably ſure: The Love of God is unchangeable; <hi>whom he loves, he</hi>

               <hi>loves to the end;</hi> whom God loves once, he loves for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; he is not as man, ſoon on and ſoon off again, ſoon in, and as ſoon out, as <hi>Joab</hi>'s dagger was! Oh no! his love is like himſelf, laſting, yea everlaſting; <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Jer. 31. 3. Though we<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 13.</note> break off with him, yet he abides faithful. Now, what can be more ſure, than that which ſprings from free love,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16.</note> from everlaſting love? Hence the Covenant muſt be ſure. The former Covenant was not ſure, becauſe it was of Works; but this Covenant is ſure, becauſe it is of Grace, and reſts not on any ſufficiency in us, but only on Grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Covenant of Grace ſprings from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> immutable counſel of God; <hi>Heb. 6. 17. God willing, more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe, the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his counſel (confirmed it by an oath:</hi>) Times are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and all ſorts of men are mutable, and the love and<note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 6. Pſal. 146. 3, 4. Jer. 33. 14.</note> favour of the creature is mutable; but the counſel of God, from which the Covenant of Grace flows, is immutable, and therefore it muſt needs be ſure. The manifeſtation of the immutability of God's counſel, is here brought in, as one end of God's Oath; God ſwears, that it might
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65138:65"/> evidently appear, that what he had purpoſed, counſelled, determined and promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, ſhould aſſuredly be accompliſhed, there ſhould be, there could be no alteration thereof: His counſel was more firm, than<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 13.</note> the Laws of the Medes and Perſians, which altereth not; certainly God's counſel is inviolable; <hi>My counſel ſhall ſtand,</hi> Iſa. 46. 10. Pſal. 33. 11. <hi>The counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations;</hi> Prov. 19. 21. <hi>Nevertheleſs, the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand.</hi> The immutability of God's counſel, ſprings from the unchangeableneſs of his eſſence, the perfection of his wiſdom, the infiniteneſs of his goodneſs, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of his ſovereignty, the omnipotency of his power; God in his eſſence, being unchangeable, his counſel alſo muſt needs be ſo; can darkneſs flow out of light, or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of emptineſs, or heaven out of hell? No; no more can changeable counſels flow from an immutable nature. Now, the Covenant of Grace, flows from the immutable counſel of God, which is moſt firm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, and therefore it muſt needs be a ſure Covenant. But.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Covenant of Grace ſprings from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> purpoſe of God, reſolving and intending everlaſting good unto us: Now this purpoſe of God is ſure, ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our graces are imperfect, our comforts ebb and flow; but God's foundation ſtands ſure.</note> That foundation of God, is his election, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a foundation; becauſe it is that, upon which, all our good and happineſs is built, and becauſe, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it abides firm and ſure. The gracious purpoſe of God, is the fountain-head of all our ſpiritual bleſſings: It is the impulſive cauſe of our vocation, juſtification, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, it is the higheſt link in the Golden chain of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; what is the reaſon that God has entred into a Covenant with fallen man? it is from his eternal purpoſe: What is the reaſon, that one man is brought under the bond of the Covenant, and not another? it is from the<note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ek. 20. 37.</note> eternal purpoſe of God. In all the great concerns of the Covenant of Grace, the purpoſe of God gives the caſting
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65138:65"/> voice: The purpoſe of God, is the ſovereign cauſe of all that good that is in man, and of all that external, internal and eternal good that comes to man: Not works paſt, for men are choſen from everlaſting; not works preſent, for <hi>Jacob</hi> was loved and choſen before he was born; nor works fore ſeen, for men were all corrupt in <hi>Adam.</hi> All a believer's preſent happineſs, and all his future happineſs ſprings from the eternal purpoſe of God; as you may ſee, by comparing the Scriptures in the margin together. This<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28. cap. 9. 11. Eph. 1. 11. cap. 3. 11. 2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> purpoſe of God ſpeaks our ſtability, and certainty of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt; God's eternal purpoſe never changes, never alters; <hi>Surely, as I have thought, ſo ſhall it come to paſs; and as I have purpoſed</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſo ſhall it ſtand:</hi> God's purpoſes are immutable, ſo is his Covenant; God's purpoſes are ſure, very ſure, ſo is his Covenant: The Covenant of Grace that flows from the eternal purpoſe of God, is as ſure as God is ſure; for God can neither deceive, nor be deceived. That Covenant that is built upon this rock of God's eternal purpoſe, muſt needs be ſure; and therefore, all that are in covenant with God, need never fear falling away; there is no man, no power, no devil, no violent temptation, that ſhall ever be able to overturn thoſe that God has brought under the bond of the Covenant; <hi>Joh. 10. 28, 29, 30, 31. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider that the Covenant of Grace, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> confirmed and made ſure by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb. 13. 20. Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. The main point which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle intended, by ſetting down the inviolableneſs of men's laſt Wills, after their death, is to prove, that Chriſts death was very requiſite for ratifying of the New Teſtament: conſult theſe ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Mat. 16. 21. Luk. 24. 26. Heb. 2. 10. cap. 2. 17.</hi>
               </note> which is called <hi>the blood of the everlaſting Covenant;</hi> Chriſt, by his irrevocable death, hath made ſure the Covenant to us. The Covenant of Grace, is to be conſidered under the notion of a Teſtament; and Chriſt, as the Teſtator of this will and teſtament. Now, look as a man's will and teſtament is irrevocably confirmed by the Teſtator's death. <hi>For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo, of neceſſity, be the death of the Teſtator; For a Teſtament is of force, after men are dead; otherwiſe, it is of no ſtrength at all, whileſt the Teſtator liveth:</hi> Theſe two verſes are added as a proof of the neceſſity of Chriſt's manner of confirming the new
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65138:66"/> Teſtament, as he did, namely by his death: The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken from the common uſe and equity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Teſtaments, which is by the death of the Teſtator. A Teſtament is only and wholly at his pleaſure that maketh it, ſo that he may alter it, or diſanul it while he liveth, as he ſeeth good; but when he is dead, he not remaining to alter it, none elſe can do it. In the ſeventeenth verſe, the Apoſtle declareth the inviolableneſs of a man's laſt will, being ratified as before, by the teſtator's death: This he ſheweth two ways: 1. Affirmatively in theſe words; <hi>A Teſtament is of force after men are dead:</hi> 2. Negatively, in theſe words, <hi>otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength.</hi> Now from the affirmative and the negative it plainly appears, that a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is made inviolable by the Teſtator's death, ſo Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath unalterably confirmed this Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; <hi>viz.</hi> The New Covenant, by his blood and<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 15.</note> death; <hi>That by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions, that were under the firſt teſtament; they which are called, might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> Chriſt died, to purchaſe an eternal inheritance; and on this ground, eternal life is called an eternal inheritance; for we come to it as heirs, through the good will, grace and favour of the purchaſer thereof, manifeſted by the laſt Will and Teſtament: Hence you read, <hi>This is my blood</hi>

Joh. 14. 6. Mark 13. 31.</note> paſs away. If the word of Chriſt be ſure, if his promiſe be ſure, if his Covenant be ſure, then ſurely his laſt Will and Teſtament, which is ratified and confirmed by his death, muſt needs be very ſure; Chriſt's blood is too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a thing to be ſpilt in vain; but in vain is it ſpilt, if his Teſtament, his Covenant, ratified thereby, be altered.

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65138:66"/> Chriſt died in vain, and our preaching is in vain, and your hearing, and receiving, and believing is all in vain: Chriſt's death is a declaration and evidence of the eternal counſel of his father, which is moſt ſtable and immutable in it ſelf; but how much more is it ſo, when it is ratified by the death of his deareſt ſon, <hi>In whom all the promiſes are, yea,</hi>

               <hi>and Amen;</hi> that is, in Chriſt they are made, performed and ratified: By all this, we may ſafely conclude, that the Covenant of Grace is a moſt ſure Covenant, there can be no addition to it, detraction from it, or alteration of it; unleſs the death of Jeſus Chriſt, whereby it's confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be fruſtrated and overthrown: Certainly, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is as ſure as Chriſt's death is ſure.

               <hi>that never dies, the fire that never goes out, or an eternal ſeparation from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> The great glory of the Covenant, is the certainty of the Covenant; and this is the top of God's glory, and of a Chriſtian's comfort, that all the mercies that are in the Covenant of Grace are, <hi>the ſure mercies of David;</hi> and that all the Grace that is in the Covenant, is ſure Grace; and that all the glory that is in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is ſure glory; and that all the external, internal and eternal bleſſings of the Covenant are ſure bleſſings.</p>
            <p>I might further argue the ſureneſs of the Covenant of Grace, from all the attributes of God, which are deeply engaged to make it good, as his wiſdom, love, power, juſtice, holineſs, faithfulneſs, righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65138:67"/> might further argue the certainty of the Covenant of Grace, from the ſeals which God hath annexed to it: You know, what was ſealed by the Kings Ring, could not be altered; God hath ſet his ſeals to this Covenant, his<note place="margin">Eſt. 8. 8.</note> broad ſeal in the Sacraments, and his privy ſeal in the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſpirit; and therefore the Covenant of Grace is ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can never be reverſed: But upon ſeveral accounts.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65138:68"/> is the Covenant of Grace. I might eaſily lay down other arguments, to evince the Covenant of Grace to be a well ordered Covenant: As for the right placing of all perſons and things in the Covenant of Grace, and from the outward diſpenſation of it: God reveiled it but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually: Firſt, he diſcovered it more darkly, remotely and imperfectly, as we ſee things a great way off; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord did more clearly, fully, immediately, frequently, and compleatly diſcover it, as we diſcern things at hand: God did not, at once, open all the riches and rarities of the Covenant to his people; but in the opening of thoſe treaſures that were there laid up, God had a reſpect to the non-age and full age of his people: And from God's diſpenſing and giving out all the good and all the great things of the Covenant in their fitteſt time, in a right and proper ſeaſon, when his people moſt need them, and when they can live no longer without them; but I muſt haſten to a cloſing up of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65138:68"/> favour and love for God to enter into Covenant with man, when he lay wallowing in his blood, and no eye pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied him, no, not his own. As there was nothing in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man, to draw God's favour or affection towards him, ſo there was every thing in fallen man, that might juſtly provoke God's wrath and indignation againſt him; and therefore it muſt be a very high act of favour and grace, for the great, the glorious, the holy, the wiſe, and the all-ſufficient God, to enter into Covenant with ſuch a forlorn creature as fallen man was: Nothing but free Grace was the foundation of the Covenant of Grace with poor ſinners.

Now, this Covenant is ſtiled the New Covenant, becauſe it is to continue new, and never to wax old, or wear away, ſo long as this world ſhall continue: Neither doth the holy Scriptures any where reveal another Covenant, which ſhall ſucceed this Covenant. If any Covenant ſhould ſucceed this, it muſt be either a Covenant of works, or a Covenant of Grace; not a Covenant of works, for that would bring us all under a curſe, and make our condition utterly deſperate; not a Covenant of Grace, becauſe more grace cannot be ſhewn in any other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, than in this; here is all grace, and all mercy, here is Jeſus Chriſt, with all his righteouſneſs, mediatorſhip, merits, purchaſe: This Covenant is ſo full, ſo ample, ſo large, ſo perfect, ſo compleat, and is every way ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the condition of loſt ſinners, that nothing can be altered, nor added, nor mended; and therefore it muſt needs be the laſt Covenant, that ever God will make with man.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65138:70"/> Breaches made in the firſt Covenant, were irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, but breaches made in the New Covenant are not ſo, becauſe this New Covenant is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt; Chriſt lies at the bottom of the Covenant, the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is an everlaſting Covenant; and all the breaches that we make upon that Covenant, are repaired and made up by the blood and interceſſion of dear Jeſus: Every jar doth not break the marriage Covenant between husband and wife, no more doth every ſin break the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that is between God and our ſouls: Every breach of peace with God, is not a breach of Covenant with God. That free, that rich, that infinite, that ſovereign, and that glorious grace of God, that ſhines in that Covenant of Grace, tells us that our eternal eſtates ſhall never be judged by a Covenant of works; and that the want of an abſolute perfection, ſhall never damn a believing ſoul; and that the obedience that God requires at our hands, is not a legal, but an Evangelical obedience: So long as a Chriſtian doth not renounce his Covenant with God, ſo long as he doth not wilfully, wickedly and habitually break the bond of the Covenant, the main, the ſubſtance of the Covenant is not yet broken, though ſome articles of the Covenant may be violated: As among men, there be ſome treſpaſſes againſt ſome particular clauſes in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, which, though they be violated, yet the whole Covenant is not forfeited; 'tis ſo here, between God and his people.</p>

A ſincere Chriſtian does not only love the Law, and like the law, and approve of the Law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law, and conſent to the Law, that it is holy, juſt and good; but he obeys it in part; which, though<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12, 16, 22.</note> it be but in part, yet he being ſincere therein, preſſing towards the mark, and deſiring and endeavouring to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13, 14.</note> at what is perfect; God accepts of ſuch a ſoul, and is as well pleaſed with ſuch a ſoul, as if he had perfectly fulfilled the Law: Where the heart is ſincerely reſolved to obey, there it does obey; an heart to obey, is our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying; a heart to do, is our doing; a heart to believe, is our believing; a heart to repent, is our repenting; a heart to wait, is our waiting; a heart to ſuffer, is our ſuffering; a heart to pray, is our praying; a heart to hear, is our hearing; a heart to give, feed, cloath, viſit, is our giving, feeding, cloathing, viſiting; a heart to walk circumſpectly, is our walking circumſpectly; a heart to work righteouſneſs, is our working righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; a heart to ſhew mercy, is our ſhewing mercy; a heart to ſympathiſe with others, is our ſympathiſing with others: He that ſincerely deſire and reſolves to keep the commandments of God, he does keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65138:74"/> of God; and he that truly deſires and reſolves to walk in the ſtatutes of God, he does walk in the ſtatutes of God.

            <p>Oh bleſſed God, in Chriſt my head, I have perfectly and compleatly kept thy Royal Law; and in my own perſon, I have Evangelically kept thy Royal Law, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of my ſincere doſires, purpoſes, reſolutions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to keep it: And this Evangelical keeping, in Chriſt, and in the New Covenant, thou art pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, and art well ſatisfied with it. I know that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65138:75"/> breaches made in the firſt Covenant, were irreparable, but breaches made in the Covenant of Grace are not ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Covenant is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt; who is ſtill a making up all breaches. Now, this is my Plea, O holy God, and by this Plea I ſhall ſtand. Well, ſaith God, I cannot in honour or juſtice, but accept of this Plea, and therefore enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</p>

Here are ears in the plural number, a token of that perfect and deſirable ſubjection, which Chriſt, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, was in to his father. But for a more clear, diſtinct and full opening of the Covenant of Redemption; or that bleſſed compact between God the father and Jeſus Chriſt, which is a matter of grand importance to all our ſouls; and conſidering that it is a point that I have never yet treated of in pulpit or preſs; I ſhall therefore, take the liberty at this time, to open my ſelf, as clearly and as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can. And therefore thus,</p>
            <p>If you ask me, what this Covenant of Redemption <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Qu. </seg>
               </label> is?</p>
            <p>I anſwer in the general, That a Covenant is a mutual <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> agreement between parties, upon articles or propoſitions on both ſides, ſo that each party is tied and bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his own conditions. This deſcription holds the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nature of a Covenant, and is common to all Covenants, publick and private, divine or humane. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, and more particularly, I anſwer, The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Redemption is that federal tranſaction, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual<note place="margin">The Covenant of Redemption de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</note> ſtipulation that was betwixt God and Chriſt from everlaſting, for the accompliſhment of the work of our Redemption, by the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal honour, and unſpeakable praiſe of the glorious grace of God. Or if you pleaſe, take it in another form of words, thus,</p>
            <p>It is a compact, bargain and agreement between God the father, and God the ſon, deſigned Mediator; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the converſion, ſanctification and ſalvation of the Elect, through the death, ſatisfaction and obedience of Jeſus Chriſt; which in due time, was to be given to the father. But for the making good the definition I have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65138:76"/> laid down, I muſt take lieve to tell you, That there are many choice Scriptures, which give clear intimation of ſuch a federal tranſaction between God the father and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in order to the recovery, and everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and ſalvation of his Elect. I ſhall inſtance in the moſt conſiderable of them.</p>

               </note> This is ſpoken of that holy enmity, that is between Chriſt and the Devil; and of Chriſt's deſtroying the Kingdom and power of Satan: <hi>For as much then, as the children are partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe, took part of the ſame; that through death, he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.</hi> Heb. 2 14.

From this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſome conclude that Chriſt covenanted from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; to take upon him the ſeed of the woman, and the ſinleſs infirmities of our true humane nature; and under thoſe infirmities, to enter the liſts with Satan, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obedient, through all his afflictions, temptations and trials to the death, even to the death of the croſs. And<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9.</note> that God the father had covenanted with Chriſt, that in caſe Chriſt did continue obedient through all his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, temptations and trials, that then his obedience to the death ſhould be accounted as full ſatisfaction to divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, for all thoſe wrongs and injuries that were done to God, by the ſins of man; Chriſt muſt die, or elſe he could not have been the Mediator of the new Covenant through death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16.

Behold my ſervant whom I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth; I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the gentiles.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt would not, yea, he could not, he durſt not thruſt himſelf upon this great work, or engage in this great work, 'till he had a clear call from heaven. 2. Here you have the gracious carriage and deportment of Chriſt, in the work to which he was called; this is fully ſet down, <hi>verſ. 2, 3, 4. He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet. He ſhall come clothed with majeſty and glory, and yet full of meekneſs: A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and the ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench; he ſhall bring forth judgement unto truth.</hi> In the words there is a <hi>Meioſis, he will not break,</hi> that is, he will bind up the bruiſed reed, he will comfort the bruiſed reed, he will ſtrengthen the bruiſed reed: Chriſt will acknowledg and encourage the leaſt degrees of grace, he will turn a ſpark of grace into a flame, a drop into a ſea, <hi>&amp;c. He ſhall not fail, nor be diſcouraged.</hi> Theſe words ſhew his Kingly courage and magnanimity. Though he ſhould meet with oppoſition from all hands, yet nothing ſhould daunt him, nothing ſhould diſmay him, no affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, no temptations, no ſufferings ſhould in the leaſt abate his courage and valour. 3. The Divine Aſſiſtance, he ſhould have from him that called him: This is ſet down in two expreſſions, <hi>verſ. 6. I will hold thy hand, I will keep thee.</hi> Divine Aſſiſtance doth uſually concur with a divine call; when God ſets his ſervants on work, he uſes to defend and uphold them in the work. 4.

God ſo protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his dear ſon, againſt all the might and malice of his moſt capital enemies; that they neither could lay hold on him, or do ought, before the time by God fore-deſigned, was come: Chriſt was ſheltered under the wing of God's protection, till that voluntarily he went to his paſſion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they keep him under, when that time was once over, though they endeavoured with all their might to do it. Now, in the the third verſe, God the father tells Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, what a glorious reward he ſhould have for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the great work of Redemption: <hi>And ſaid unto me, thou art my ſervant, O Iſrael, in whom I will be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> God having called Chriſt, ſet him apart, ſanctified
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65138:78"/> him, and ſent him into the world, for the execution of the office of a Redeemer: He doth, in this third verſe, encourage him to ſet upon it, and to go on chearfully, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and conſtantly in it, with aſſurance of good and comfortable ſucceſs; notwithſtanding all the plots; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and oppoſitions, that Satan and his Imps might make againſt him; <hi>verſ. 4. Then I ſaid, I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought, and in vain; yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my judgment is with the Lord, and my works with my God.</hi> In theſe words, Jeſus Chriſt complains to his father of the incredulity, wickedneſs and obſtinate Rebellion of the greateſt part of the Jews, againſt that bleſſed word which he had clearly and faithfully made known to them: When Chriſt looked upon the paucity and ſmall number of thoſe that his Miniſtry had any ſaving and powerful work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he pours out his complaints before the father; not that Chriſt's pains in his miniſtry among the Jews, were wholly in vain, either in regard of God that ſent him, or in regard of the perſons, unto whom he was ſent; as if not any at all were converted: Oh no! for ſome were called, converted and ſanctified, as you may ſee by the Scriptures in the margin: Or in regard of himſelf, as if any loſs or prejudice ſhould thereby redound unto him: Oh no! but in regard of the ſmall, the ſlender effect, that his great labours had hitherto found; <hi>yet ſurely my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is with the Lord.</hi> Chriſt, for the better ſupport and re-encouraging of himſelf, to perſiſt in his employment, oppoſeth unto the want of the chiefly deſired ſucceſs of his labours with men, the gracious acceptance of them with God. It is as if Chriſt had ſaid, although my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hath not produced ſuch fruits and effects as I indeed deſired, yet I do comfort and bear up my heart with this, that my heavenly father knows, that in the office and place wherein he hath ſet me, I have faithfully done all that could be done for the ſalvation of poor ſinners ſouls, and for the ſecuring of them from wrath to come: <hi>And my work</hi> (or reward) <hi>with my God,</hi> that is, the reward of my work, or my wages for my work, which God will render
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65138:79"/> unto me, not according to the iſſue or ſucceſs of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but according to my pains therein taken, and the faithful diſcharge of my office and duty therein: What ſaith Chriſt, though the Jews believe not, repent not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn not to the moſt high, yet my labour is not loſt; for my God will really, he will ſignally reward me: Upon this, God the father comes off more freely and roundly, and opens his heart more abundantly to Jeſus Chriſt, and tells him in the fifth and ſixth verſes following, that he will give him full, compleat and honourable ſatisfaction, for all his pains and labours in preaching, in doing, in ſuffering, and dying, that he might bring many ſons to glory, <hi>verſ. 5. And now, ſaith the Lord, that formed me from the womb, to be his ſervant, to bring Jacob again to him: though Iſrael is not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength.</hi> In this verſe, you have a farther encouragement to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; God the father engaging himſelf, not only to ſupport him and protect him in the work of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but of making him glorious in it, and by it alſo; and that though his work ſhould not prove ſo ſucceſsful among his own people as he deſired, yet his Miniſtry ſhould become very glorious and efficacious upon the Gentiles far and near, throughout the whole world. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is very confident of his being high in the eſteem of his father, for the faithful diſcharge of his duty: And that, notwithſtanding all the hard meaſure that he met with from the body of the Jews, that yet his father would<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 20, 23. cap. 10. 15, 17. Joh. 17. 1, 5. Thil. 2. 9.</note> crown him with honour and glory; and that he would enable him to go through the work that is incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and that he would protect him and defend him in his work, againſt all might and malice, all power and policy, that ſhould make head againſt him; <hi>verſ. 6. And he ſaid, it is a light thing, that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of Iſrael: I will alſo give thee, for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> Thus you ſee, that God the father ſtill goes on to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65138:79"/> ſhew, that the labours of Chriſt ſhould be very glorious, not only in the eyes of God, but in the eyes of all the world: Yow know, elſewhere Chriſt is called the way,<note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God the father, ſpeaking to Jeſus Chriſt, tells him, that it was but a ſmall matter, a mean thing (<hi>Heb.</hi> it is too light) for him to have ſuch happy and ample ſucceſs, as to reduce and win the Jews in compariſon of that further work that he intended to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by him, even the ſalvation of the Gentiles, unto the ends of earth. God the father ſeems to ſay thus to Jeſus Chriſt, the dignity and worthineſs of thy perſon, thou being the eternal, and only ſon of God; as alſo the high office, whereunto I have called thee, requireth more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things, than that thou ſhouldeſt only raiſe up and reſtore the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their right: I have alſo appointed and ordained thee for a Saviour to the Gentiles, even to the ends of the earth; therefore, though the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Both parties are very ſure and confident of the event
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65138:80"/> of the paction, and of the accompliſhment of the whole work of Redemption; <hi>Behold, my ſervant ſhall deal pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, he ſhall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</hi> Here are divers terms heaped up, to expreſs in part, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent and unexpreſſible advancement of Jeſus Chriſt; when men are raiſed from a mean and low eſtate, to ſome honourable condition; when men are furniſhed with ſuch parts and endowments of prudence, wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as makes them admirable in the eyes of others; and when they are enabled to do and ſuffer great things; whereby they become famous and renowned far and near, then we ſay they are highly exalted: Now in all the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was moſt eminently exalted above all creatures in heaven and earth, as is moſt evident throughout the Scriptures. Thirdly, He tells you of the price, which Jeſus Chriſt ſhould pay for the Redemption of his people, agreed upon by paction, <hi>viz.</hi> the humbling of himſelf to the death of the Croſs, as you may ſee in <hi>verſ. 14.

Oh ſirs! the words laſt cited, are not ſo to be underſtood, as if our bleſſed Saviour had, in regard of his bodily perſon or preſence, been ſome ſtrange, deformed or miſhapen creature; but<note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 3.</note> in regard of his outward eſtate, coming of mean and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure parents, living in a low deſpicable condition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſcorn and contempt, and to much affliction,

The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed:</hi> Chriſt was chaſtiſed, to procure our peace, by removal of our ſins, that ſet God and us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder; the guilt thereof being diſcharged with the price of his blood, and we reconciled to God by the ſame price; Chriſt was puniſhed, that we, by him, might obtain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace with God, who was at enmity with us, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our ſins; by Chriſt's ſtripes we are freed, both from ſin and puniſhment. Now, becauſe ſome produce this Scripture, to juſtifie that corrupt doctrine of univerſal Redemption, give me leave to argue thus from it; That chaſtiſement for ſin, that was laid upon the perſon of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, procured peace for them, for whom he was ſo chaſtiſed; but there was no peace procured for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,<note place="margin">Iſa 57. 21.

There is no healing of their bruiſe; Ergo.</hi> But,</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:65138:82"/>
            <p>Fifthly, Obſerve with me, that the great and the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſufferings, that were inflicted upon Jeſus Chriſt, he did endure freely, willingly, meekly, patiently, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant and agreement that was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the father and himſelf; <hi>verſ. 7. He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> This is a very pregnant place, to prove the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt's ſufferings for our ſins. If we look upon the words, as they run in the original, for thus they run; It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, and he anſwered; that is, the penalty due to God's juſtice for our ſins, was exacted of Chriſt, and he ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame for us. The Prophet doth not ſpeak of one and the ſame party, or parties, both ſinning and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſuſtaining penalties for their own defaults; but as one ſuffering for the ſins of another, and ſuſtaining grievous penalties, for faults made, and faults committed by other perſons. The words rightly read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, do ſufficiently confirm the doctrine of ſatisfaction, made to God's juſtice, by Chriſt's ſufferings for our ſins; the penalty due to us was, in rigour of juſtice, exacted of him, and he became a ſponſor or ſurety for us, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking in our behalf the diſcharge of it; Chriſt did voluntarily undertake, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Obſerve with me, That the original cauſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> this compact or Covenant between the father and the ſon, by vertue of which, God the father demands a price, and Jeſus Chriſt pays the price according to God's demands, is only from the free grace and favour of God; <hi>verſ. 10. It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief.</hi> God the father looks upon Jeſus Chriſt; as ſuſtaining our perſon and cauſe; he looks upon all our ſins, as laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and to be puniſhed in him: Sin could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, the juſtice of God could not be ſatisfied, the wrath of God could not be appeaſed, the terrible curſe could not be removed, but by the death of Chriſt; and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65138:83"/> therefore God the father took a pleaſure to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief, according to the agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his ſon. It muſt be readily granted, that God did not incite or inſtigate the wicked Jews, to thoſe vile and cruel courſes and carriages of their to Jeſus Chriſt; but yet, that his ſufferings were by God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for the ſalvation of mankind, is moſt evident by the Scriptures in the margin; and accordingly, it pleaſed<note place="margin">Act. 2. 23. cap. 4. 28.</note> the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief. The ſingular pleaſure that God the father takes in the work of our Redemption, is a wonderful demonſtration of his love and affection to us.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Obſerve with me, That it is agreed between <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the father and the ſon, that our ſins ſhall be imputed unto him, and that his righteouſneſs ſhould be imputed unto us, and that all the redeemed ſhall believe in him, and ſo be juſtified; <hi>vrrſ. 11. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied, by his knowledg</hi> (or faith in him) <hi>ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many; for he ſhall hear their iniquities.</hi> Or as ſome render it, He ſhall ſee the fruit of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied; That is, Jeſus Chriſt ſhall receive and enjoy that, as the effect and iſſue of all the great pains that he hath taken, and of all the grievous things that he hath ſuffered, as ſhall give him full content and ſatisfaction; when Chriſt hath accompliſhed the work of Redemption, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a full reward for all his ſufferings. Chriſt takes a ſingular pleaſure in the work of our Redemption, and doth herein, as it were, refreſh himſelf, as with the fruits of his own labours. God the father engages to Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould not travel in vain, but that he ſhould ſurvive to ſee with great joy, a numerous iſſue of faithful ſouls begotten unto God; you know when wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, after ſore, ſharp, hard labour, are delivered, they are ſo greatly refreſhed, delighted, gladded and ſatisfied, that they forget their former pains and ſorrow, <hi>for joy that a manchild is born into the world.</hi> God the father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes,<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 21.</note> that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have ſuch a holy ſeed,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65138:84"/> ſuch a bleſſed iſſue, as the main fruit and effect of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſhould joy him, pleaſe him, and as he ſhould reſt ſatisfied in: Certainly there could be no ſuch joy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Chriſt, as for him to ſee poor ſouls reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, juſtified and ſaved by his ſufferings and ſatisfaction; as 'tis the higheſt joy of a faithful miniſter, to ſee ſouls<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 19, 20. Gal. 4. 19.</note> won over to Chriſt, &amp; to ſee ſouls built up in Chriſt: Chriſt did bear the guilt of his peoples ſins, and thereby he made full ſatisfaction; and therefore he is ſaid here, to juſtifie many; not all promiſcuouſly, but thoſe only, whoſe ſins he undertook to diſcharge, and for whom he laid down his life. Chriſt's juſtifying of many, is his diſcharging of many from the guilt of ſin, by making ſatisfaction to God for the ſame. But,</p>

But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Obſerve that God rejects all ways of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by men: Could men make as many prayers as there be ſtars in heaven, and drops in the Sea; and could they<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 3.</note> weep as much blood, as there is water in the Ocean; and

               <hi>I may glory in my own works, I have not whence I may boaſt my ſelf; and therefore I will glory in Chriſt; I will not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that I am righteous, but I will glory that I am redeemed; I will glory, not becauſe I am without ſin, but becauſe my ſins are forgiven; I will not glory becauſe I have profited, or becauſe any hath profited me, but becauſe Chriſt is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the father for me, but becauſe the blood of Chriſt is ſhed for me.</hi> Certainly, the Popiſh Doctrine of man's own ſatisfaction, in part for his ſins, is moſt derogatory, to the blood, and to the plenary and complete ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, that nothing below the obedience and ſufferings of Chriſt our Mediator, could ſatisfie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, <hi>Heb. 10. 5.

By body is meant the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Chriſt: Body is Synecdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally put for the whole humane nature, conſiſting of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul; the body was the viſible part of Chriſt's hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: A body is fit for a ſacrifice, fit to be ſlain, fit to have blood ſhed out of it, fit to be offered up, fit to be made a price, and a ranſom for our ſins, and fit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the types under the Law: Pertinently therefore, to this purpoſe, is it ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He himſelf bare our ſins</hi>

               <hi>in his own body;</hi> and thoſe infirmities, wherein he was <hi>made like unto us,</hi> were moſt conſpicuouſly evidenced in his body; and hereby Chriſt was manifeſted to be a true man, he had a body like ours, a body ſubject to manifold infirmities, yea to death it ſelf. That body which Chriſt had, is ſaid to <hi>be prepared by God;</hi> the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is tranſlated <hi>prepared,</hi> is a Metaphor from Mechanicks, who do artificially fit one part of their work to another, and ſo finiſh the whole. God fitted his ſon's body to be joyned with the Deity, and to be an expiatory ſacrifice for ſin. The word <hi>prepared</hi> implies, that God the father <hi>ordained,</hi> formed and made fit and able, Chriſt's humane nature, to undergo, ſuffer and fulfil that, for which he was ſent into the world. God the father is here ſaid, to have prepared Chriſt a body; becauſe Chriſt hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received of his father, the humane nature, out of the fleſh and blood of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by the power of the<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 20. Luk, 1. 31. 35.</note> Holy Ghoſt; here gives up the ſame unto the ſervice of his father, to do, to ſuffer, to die, that he might be a ſacrifice of expiation for our ſins. As for the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 40. 6. Mine ear haſt thou opened,</hi> Heb. <hi>digged open.</hi> It is a proverbial manner of ſpeech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there is implyed, the qualifying or fitting a man unto obedience in ſervice; the ear, or the opening of the ear,<note place="margin">Iſa. 50 5. Job, 3. 16.</note> being an emblem, or ſymbol, or a Metaphorical ſign of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65138:88"/> Now, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> following the tranſlation of the Septuagint, and being directed by the ſpirit of God, expounds this, of God's ſanctifying and fitting a body unto Chriſt; wherein hs was obedient, even unto the ſhameful death of the Croſs: Theſe words, <hi>thou haſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through mine ears,</hi> do import, that Chriſt, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming man; gives up himſelf to be a willing ſervant of his father, to obey him unto the death of the croſs. And it is a ſimilitude taken from the ſervants of the Hebrews; who, after that they had ſerved their maſters ſix years, would not depart out of their maſter's ſervice the ſeventh year, but abide in it continually until death; for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whereof, their ear was bored thorow on the poſts of the door; as may be ſeen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as much as if he ſhould ſay, thou haſt given me a body that is willing and ready in thy ſervice, even unto death. But to conclude this head, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of diſanulling the ſacrifice of the Law, he uſes this word body, to ſet out a ſacrifice, which ſhould come in ſtead of the legal ſacrifices, to effect that which the legal ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices could not effect. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Obſerve that Chriſt our Mediator freely and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> readily offers himſelf to be our pledg and ſurety; <hi>Then ſaid I, lo, I come,</hi> to wit, as ſurety, to pay the ranſome, and to do thy will, O God: Every word carrieth a ſpecial emphaſis; as, 1. The time, Then; even, ſo ſoon as he perceived that his father had prepared his body for ſuch an end; then without delay, this ſpeed implyeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and readineſs, he would loſe no opportunity: 2. His profeſſion in this word, <hi>ſaid I;</hi> he did not cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſecretly, timorouſly, as being aſhamed thereof, but he maketh profeſſion before-hand: 3. This note of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Lo;</hi> this is a kind of calling Angels and men to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a deſire that all might know his inward intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the diſpoſition of his heart; wherein was as great a willingneſs, as any could have to any thing: 4. An offering of himſelf, without any enforcement or compulſion, this he manifeſteth in this word, <hi>I come:</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:65138:88"/> 5. That very inſtant ſet out in the preſent tenſe, <hi>I come;</hi> he puts it not off to a future and uncertain time, but even in that moment, he ſaith, <hi>I come:</hi> 6. The firſt perſon twice expreſſed, thus, <hi>I ſaid, I come;</hi> he ſendeth not another perſon, nor ſubſtituteth any in his room; but he, even he himſelf in his own perſon, cometh. All which do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly evidence Chriſt's ſingular readineſs and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, as our ſurety, to do his father's will, though it were by ſuffering, and by being made a ſacrifice for our ſins. God's will was the rule of Chriſt's active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience: Jeſus Chriſt, our only Mediatour and ſurety, by free and ready obedience and death, did make a proper, real and full ſatisfaction to God's juſtice, for the ſins of all the Elect. Chriſt hath, by his death and blood, as an invaluable price of our redemption, made ſure the favour of God, the pardon of our ſins, and the ſalvation of our ſouls: Chriſt hath freed his choſen from all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, ſpiritual, and eternal puniſhments, properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſo that now, the mercy of God may embrace the ſinner, without the leaſt of wrong to his truth or juſtice. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Obſerve that Jeſus Chriſt our ſurety does not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> only agree with his father, about the price that he was to lay down for our redemption, but alſo agrees with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, about the perſons that were to be redeemed, and their ſanctification; <hi>Heb. 10. 10. By the which will</hi> (that is, by the execution of which will, by the obedience of Chriſt to his heavenly father) <hi>we are ſanctified, through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, once for all:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt agrees with the father, that all thoſe ſhall be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for whom he has ſuffered and ſatisfied. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, efficacy and benefit of that which ariſeth from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid will of the father and of the ſon, is expreſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this word, <hi>ſanctified:</hi> To paſs by the notation, and divers acceptations of this word, <hi>ſanctified,</hi> let it ſuffice to tell you; It is not here to be taken, as diſtinguiſhed from juſtification or glorification, as it is elſe where taken; but<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30. cap. 6. 11.</note> ſo as compriſing under it, all the benefits of Chriſt's ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

Chriſt's body was given up as a price and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and offered up as a ſacrifice for our ſins; and that we might be ſanctified and made holy, Chriſt, by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of his body once for all, has purchaſed of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, grace and holineſs for all his redeemed ones: Chriſt agrees with his father, that he will lay down an incomparable price for his choſen ones; and then he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agrees with his father, that all thoſe ſhall be ſanctified, for whom he has laid down an invaluable price. The will of God the father was, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that that body of his ſhould be offered up, that his Elect might be ſanctified and ſaved: Now, to this Chriſt readily anſwers, <hi>Loe, I come to do thy will.</hi> From what hath been ſaid from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. we may very ſafely and roundly conclude, that it is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65138:89"/> moſt clear and evident, that there was a Covenant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact or agreement between God the father and Jeſus Chriſt, concerning the Redemption of fallen man. This I ſhall more abundantly clear up, before I have ſaid all I have to ſay about the Covenant of Redemption, that is under our preſent conſideration. But,</p>

            <p>By theſe ten Scriptures, it is moſt cleare and evident, that there was a Covenant, a compact and agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God the father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the work of our Redemption. Chriſt's being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the ſurety of the better Covenant,</hi> ſhews that there was<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 22.</note> a Covenant between God the father and him, as there is between a creditour and a ſutety; Chriſt gave bonds (as it were) to God the father, and payed down the debt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nail, that breaches might be made up between God and us, and we reſtored to divine favour for ever. But for the further clearing up of the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, I ſhall, in the ſecond place, lay down theſe propoſitions: And</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, That the Covenant of Redemption<note place="margin">The Firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> differs from the Covenant of Grace. 'Tis true, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption is a Covenant of Grace, but 'tis not properly that Covenant of Grace, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture holds out in oppoſition to the Covenant of works; which I ſhall thus evidence: 1. The Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption differs from the Covenant of Grace, in regard of the Federates; in the Covenant of Redemption, 'tis God the father and Jeſus Chriſt, that mutually covenant;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65138:91"/> but in the Covenant of Grace, the confederates are God and believers. 2. In the Covenant of Redemption, God the father requires of Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould ſuffer, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d his blood, die, and make himſelf an offering for our ſins: In the Covenant of Grace, God requires of us, that we ſhould believe and embrace the Lord Jeſus. 3. In the Covenant of Redemption, God the father has made many great, precious and glorious promiſes to Jeſus Chriſt As, <hi>ſit on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Ezek. 36. 26, 27.</note> And, <hi>I will be to him a father and he ſhall be to me a ſon:</hi> But in the Covenant of Grace, God promiſes to us Grace and glory, holineſs and happineſs, both the upper and the lower ſprings. 4. The Covenant of Redemption betwixt God and Chriſt, ſecures the Covenant of Grace betwixt God and believers; for what God promiſes to us, he did<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2.</note> before the foundation of the world, promiſe to Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore, if God the father ſhould not make good his promiſes to his Saints, he would not make good his promiſes to his deareſt ſon, which for any to imagine, would be high Blaſphemy. God will be ſure to keep touch with Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore, we may reſt fully aſſured, that he will not fail to keep touch with us. 5. The Covenant of Redemption is the very baſis or bottom of the Covenant of Grace: God made a Covenant with Chriſt the ſpiritual <hi>David,</hi> that he might make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant<note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 3 4.

But,</p>
            <p>The ſecond Propoſition is this, God the father, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">The Second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> to man's Redemption and Salvation, ſtands ſtiffly and peremptorily upon compleat ſatisfaction; without full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, no remiſſion, no ſalvation: Satisfaction God
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65138:91"/> will have to the utmoſt, though it coſt Chriſt his life and blood: Man is fallen from his primitive purity, glory<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> and excellency, and by his fall, he hath provoked divine juſtice, tranſgreſſed God's righteous Law, and caſt a deep diſhonour upon his name; the caſe ſtanding thus, God is reſolved to have ample ſatisfaction, in the reparation of this honour, in the manifeſtation of his truth, and in the vindication of his holineſs and juſtice. All the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, are alike dear to him, and he ſtands as much upon the advance of his juſtice, as he does upon the glory of his Grace; and therefore he will not remit one ſin, yea, not the leaſt ſin, without entire ſatisfaction: In this God the father is fixt, that he will have <hi>an offering for</hi>

Thus you ſee, that God ſtands upon full ſatisfaction, and will admit of no treaty of peace with fallen man without it: Now, ſorry man is never able, either by doing or ſuffering, to compenſate, and make God amends for the wrong and injury, that he has done to God by his ſin; and therefore, one that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by doing and ſuffering, to give compleat ſatisfaction, muſt undertake it, or elſe we are loſt, caſt and undone, in both worlds. Concerning that full and compleat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that Jeſus Chriſt has given to God's enraged Juſtice, I have in part diſcovered already, and ſhall ſay more to it, before I cloſe up the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Much matter of admiration doth the work of Redemption afford us: The work of Creation is many ways admirable, yet not to be compared with the work of Redemption; wherein the power, wiſdom, juſtice, mercy, and other divine attributes of God, do much more ſhine forth; and wherein the redeemed reap much more good, than <hi>Adam</hi> did by his creation; which will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, by obſerving theſe particular differences.</p>

It was free grace that put God the father upon finding out a way for the redemption of loſt ſinners; It was free Grace that put God upon providing of ſuch a ſurety, as ſhould undertake the work of Redemption, as ſhould carry on the work of Redemption, and as ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh and compleat the work of Redemption: And it was free grace that moved God the father to accept of what Chriſt did and ſuffered, in order to the bringing about of our Redemption; and it is free Grace, that moves God to make an application of this Redemption, to the ſouls of his people.

            <p>The Third excellent Property of that Redemption, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that we have by Jeſus Chriſt, is this, it is a full and plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous Redemption, <hi>Pſal. 130. 7.

            <p>The Fourth excellent Property of that Redemption, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that we have by Jeſus Chriſt, is this; It is an eternal, a permanent, a laſting, yea, an everlaſting Redemption: <hi>Heb. 9. 12.

By force and might: Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> redeemed his brother <hi>Lot,</hi> and the people that<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 16.</note> were captives with him, by overcoming their enemies. 3. By ranſom, or paying a price; Thus an Hebrew that<note place="margin">Levit. 25. 48, 49.</note> was ſold a ſlave to a ſtranger, might be redeemed by one of his brethren; the laſt of theſe is moſt agreeable to the notation of the ſeveral words, which in the three learned languages, do ſignify to redeem; though the laſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially intended: In that, mention is made of a price, namely Chriſt's blood; yet the other two are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exempted, for Chriſt hath all thoſe three ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his people: This will more clearly appear, if we duly weigh the diſtinct kinds of bondage in which we<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We were ſlaves to Satan: 1. As debtors, Chriſt hath paid a ranſom for us: 2. As children of wrath, Chriſt makes interceſſion for us: 3. But though Divine Juſtice be ſatisfied, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath pacified, yet the Devil will not let his captives go, therefore Chriſt, by a ſtrong hand, wreſts us out of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's power, <hi>and deſtroys him that had the power of death,</hi>

               <hi>that is, the devil.</hi> The Ranſom which Chriſt paid, was the ground of man's full and eternal Redemption; for by ſatisfaction of juſtice, way was made to pacifie wrath, both which being accompliſhed, the Devil loſt his right and power over ſuch as he held in bondage. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is a full freedom from all miſery, and compriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under it reconciliation, juſtification, ſanctification and ſalvation: By this Redemption, divine juſtice is ſatisfied, wrath pacified, grace procured, and all ſpiritual enemies vanquiſhed.

It implieth a vertue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, from the beginning of the world, for Chriſt was <hi>a lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world:</hi> Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 8.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65138:95"/> is, and which was, and which is to come.</hi> Now, that which is ſpoken of the perſon of Chriſt, may very well be applied to our Redemption by Chriſt. This Epithete <hi>Eternal,</hi> is here added to Redemption, in oppoſition to the <hi>legal purifications,</hi> which were momentary and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary: They had a day, and endured no longer than the time of reformation. On this ground, by juſt and neceſſary conſequence, it followeth; that the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrought by Chriſt, is abſolutely perfect, and that there is no need of any other. This being eternal, all that have been, all that ſhall be redeemed, have been, and ſhall be redeemed by it; and they who are redeemed by it, need no other means. The liberty whereinto Chriſt Jeſus brings the Elect, is permanent and laſting, it abides irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable and unchangeable to all Eternity. The Jews which had ſold themſelves to be ſervants, were to be ſet free at the Jubilee, yet the Jubilee laſted but for one year;<note place="margin">Levit. 25.</note> therefore the ſame perſons might afterwards become bondmen again.

The Jewiſh Doctors ſay, that this tree was bitter, and they give us this note upon it; That it is the manner of the bleſſed God, to ſweeten that which is bitter, by that which is bitter. I ſhall not diſpute about the truth of their notion; but this I may ſafely ſay, that it is the manner of the bleſſed God, to ſweeten our greateſt troubles, and our ſharpeſt trials, by that Redemption that we have by Jeſus Chriſt. And thus you ſee the excellent properties of that Redemption that Jeſus Chriſt, by Covenant or compact with his father, was engaged to work for us. But</p>
            <p>The Fourth Propoſition is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the bleſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and glorious titles that are given to Jeſus Chriſt, in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65138:97"/> holy Scriptures, do clearly and ſtrongly evidence, that there was a Covenant of Redemption paſſed between God the father and Jeſus Chriſt.

Again, ſometimes Chriſt is called <hi>the ſurety of a better covenant.</hi> By ſo much<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 22.</note> was Jeſus made a ſurety of a better Teſtament, ſo called from the manner of the confirmation of it, <hi>viz.</hi> by the death of Chriſt. Look, as Chriſt was our ſurety to God, for the diſcharge of our debt (the ſurety and debtor, in law, are reputed as one perſon) ſo he is God's ſurety to us, for the performance of his promiſes: The office of a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being applied to Chriſt ſheweth, that he hath ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf for us, as that he neither can nor will ſtart from his engagement: You ſhall as ſoon remove the earth, ſtop the Sun in his courſe, empty the Sea with a cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, make a world, and unmake your ſelves, as any power on earth, or in hell, ſhall ever be able to hinder Chriſt, from the performance of the office of a ſurety.

Mat. 3. 15.</note> and by being made under the Law, he hath fulfilled all righteouſneſs; and that he did this for us, is evident by that phraſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 5. 19. By the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous:</hi> The contents of the Law muſt be accompliſhed by our ſurety, or elſe we can<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10. 13.</note> never eſcape the curſe of the Law; there muſt be a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law from us in our perſons, unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our ſurety, or we are undone, and that for ever.

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> 
               <hi>of God in him:</hi> Our ſurety became ſubject to the Law, that he might redeem us that were obnoxious to the Law. Again, full ſatisfaction for every tranſgreſſion is required of man: Now Chriſt our ſurety, hath made ſatisfaction for all our ſins, <hi>He was made a curſe for us;</hi> and by that<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> means he hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law: To
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65138:98"/> exact a debt which is fully ſatisfied, is a point of injuſtice; now Chriſt our ſurety, having made full ſatisfaction for all our ſins, we need not fear to ſtand before the face of God's juſtice. A debtor that hath a ſurety that is able and willing to pay his debt, yea, who hath fully paid it, need fear no colours. This Title, a ſurety of a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, does neceſſarily import a bleſſed Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jeſus Chriſt and his dear father, to whom he freely and readily becomes ſurety for us; for what is ſuretiſhip, but a voluntary transferring of another's debt upon the ſurety, he obliging to pay the debt for which he engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as ſurety. Thus you ſee by the bleſſed and glorious Titles that are given to Jeſus Chriſt in the Scriptures, that there was a Covenant of Redemption paſt between God the father and Jeſus Chriſt. But,</p>
            <p>The Fifth Propoſition is this, That the work of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Redemption and Salvation, was tranſacted between God the father and Jeſus Chriſt, before the foundation of the world: This federal tranſaction between the father and the ſon, was from eternity; upon this account, the Lord<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 13 8. God loved his people, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, and contrived all their happineſs before they were, yea, before the world was.</note> Jeſus is ſaid, to be <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> becauſe that it was agreed and covenanted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God the father and Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould, in the fulneſs of time, be made fleſh, and die for ſinners; and therefore it was ſaid to be done from the foundation of the world. Though Chriſt was not actually ſlain, but when he ſuffered for us upon the Croſs, yet he was ſlain from the beginning; in God's purpoſe, in God's decrees, in God's promiſes, in the ſacrifices, in the faith of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and in the martyrs; for <hi>Abel,</hi> the firſt that ever died, died a Martyr, he died for Religion. This compact betwixt the father and the ſon, bears date from Eternity; this the Apoſtle aſſerts, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. who hath ſaved us and called</hi>

               <hi>us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi> Here is grace giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began: But what grace was that which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65138:99"/> the world began? doubtleſs it was the Grace of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which God in his purpoſe and decree, had given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture laſt cited does clearly ſhew, that God the father and Jeſus Chriſt dealt together about the Redemption of ſouls, before the world began; and that all our everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments were agreed on, and made ſure between them; ſo that <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2. gives the ſame ſound, <hi>In hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began.</hi> How was this life promiſed before the world began, but in this Covenant of Redemption, wherein God<note place="margin">The whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was firſt tranſacted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the father and Chriſt, before it was reveiled to us; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. The Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſpeaking of our Redemption by the precious blood of Chriſt, ſaith, That Chriſt was fore-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (thereunto) before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 20.</hi>
               </note> the father promiſed and engaged to Jeſus Chriſt, that he would give eternal life to all his ſeed? So the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>He hath choſen us in him</hi> (that is, in Chriſt) <hi>before the foundation of the world.</hi> There was an eternal contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, compact, covenant or agreement between God the father and Jeſus Chriſt, concerning the ſanctification, holineſs and ſalvation of the Elect. God agrees with Chriſt, about the everlaſting happineſs of his choſen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began. So <hi>Joh. 10. 16. And other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold; them alſo, I muſt bring.</hi> Why muſt he bring them home? how was he bound, how was he engaged to bring home his other ſheep, that he puts a <hi>muſt</hi> upon it? <hi>them alſo I muſt bring:</hi> Doubtleſs, it was from this Covenant and agreement which he had made with God the father, wherein he had engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to bring home all his Elect. Chriſt takes a great deal of pains to bring home his ſheep; being bound in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption, to preſent all that are given him by charter, blameleſs before the father; therefore, ſaith<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 22.</note> he, I bring them, and <hi>I muſt bring them;</hi> the matter not being leſt arbitrary, even in reſpect of his obligation to<note place="margin">

Certainly the Decree, Covenant and agreement between God the father and Jeſus Chriſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the whole way of Redemption, about all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſalvation of the Elect, to be brought about in due time; was fixed and ſetled before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Ponder ſeriouſly on this, it may well be a load-ſtone
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65138:99"/> to draw out your hearts more than ever, to love the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the ſon, and to delight in the father and the ſon, and to act faith upon the father and the ſon, and to long to be with the father and the ſon, and all your days to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the love of the father and the ſon; who have from eternity, by compact and agreement, ſecured your ſouls and your everlaſting concernments. But,</p>
            <p>The Sixth Propoſition is this, That God the father had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the firſt and chief hand in this great work of ſaving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by vertue of this Covenant of Redemption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> he and his ſon had agreed to bring <hi>many ſons to glory:</hi> Weak Chriſtians many times have their thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions more buſied and taken up with the love of the ſon, than with the love of the father; but they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that in the great and glorious work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, God the father had a great hand, an eminent hand, yea, the firſt and chief hand: God the father firſt laid the foundation ſtone of all our happineſs and bleſſedneſs; his head and heart was firſt taken up about that heaven-born project, the ſalvation of ſinners, <hi>Iſa. 28. 16. Therefore, thus ſaith the Lord God, behold, I lay in Zion for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner ſtone, a ſure foundation;</hi> (Heb. <hi>I am he that foundeth a ſtone in Zion.</hi>) It is God the father that hath long ſince, laid Chriſt as a ſure foundation, for all his people to build their hopes of happineſs upon; it is he that firſt laid Chriſt the true cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 33. 1 Pet. 2. 6.

Our Redemption by a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, is God's own invention, and God's only invention. The bleſſed Ranſom which the Lord has found out for poor ſinners, is the blood of his own deareſt ſon (a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom which never entred into the thoughts or hearts of Angels and men, till God had reveiled it) which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the blood of the Covenant,</hi> becauſe thereby the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is confirmed, and all Covenant-mercies aſſured to us,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note>

O! what manner of love is this, for God to give his ſon, not his ſervant; his begotten ſon, not his adopted ſon; his only ſon, and not one ſon of many; his only ſon by eternal generation, and communication of the ſame Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; to be a Ranſom and Mediator for ſinners! God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loving loſt man, ſent his ſon to ſuffer, and to do the office of a Mediator; that through his mediation, he might communicate the effects of his love, in a way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his juſtice; for God loved the world, and that antecedently, to his giving Chriſt, and as a cauſe of it. The deſign, the project of ſaving ſinners, was firſt contrived and laid by God the father; therefore Chriſt ſays, <hi>The ſon can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the father do:</hi> God the father ſent his ſon, and God the father ſealed his ſon a commiſſion, to give life to loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Him hath God the father ſealed;</hi> that is, made his Commiſſion authentical, as men do their Deeds by their ſeals.

               <hi>own will, but the will of him that ſent me:</hi> In this verſe, Chriſt declares in the general; that his errand into the world, is to do his father's will who ſent him, and not his own; which is not to be underſtood that, as God, he hath a different and contrary will to the fathers (though, as man, he hath a diſtinct and ſubordinate will to his) but the meaning is, he came not to do his own will only (as the Jews alledged againſt him) but the father's alſo; and that in this work, he was the father's Commiſſioner, ſent to do what he had entruſted him with; and not as the Jews gave out, that he was one, who did that for which he had no warrant. Chriſt, in entertaining them that come to him (as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 37.) is not only led thereunto by his own mercy, and bounty, and love towards them, as the reward of all his ſufferings; but doth alſo ſtand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged thereunto, by vertue of a Commiſſion and truſt laid upon him by the father, and accepted and undertaken by him; therefore he doth mention <hi>the will of him that ſent him,</hi> as a reaſon of his fidelity in this matter.

It is good to look upon God the father, as the firſt projector of our happineſs and bleſſedneſs, that we may honour the father as we honour the ſon, and love the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as we love the ſon, and value the father as we value the ſon, &amp; admire the father as we admire the ſon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the father as we exalt the ſon, and cleave to the father as we cleave to the ſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have a little the longer inſiſted on this propoſiton, becauſe, commonly we are more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the love of the ſon, than we are of the love of the father; &amp; that I may the more heighten your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the father's love, in the great work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>The Eighth Propoſition is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were commandments from the father to the ſon, which he muſt obey and ſubmit to.

               </gap>, that they are, from Eternity, given to Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption, as the reward of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, to come to him in due time; and that they are given to him in truſt, and that he muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for them, as being given by the father to him.<note place="margin">Iſal. 24. 1.</note> They were the father's firſt, not only by the right of Creation, but by particular Election alſo; and being thus the father's, they are given to Chriſt, from eternity to be redeemed by him, and as the reward of his ſufferings. Again, ſuch as are elected and given to Chriſt, will certainly, in due time, come to him: Their being given from eternity, produceth their being given, and coming in time; for God is faithful, who will not fruſtrate Chriſt of what he hath purchaſed, and the power that draweth them is invincible and irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; therefore, ſaith he, <hi>All that the father giveth me, ſhall come to me.</hi> Again, Chriſt, in entertaining them that come to him, is not only led thereunto by his own mercy, and bounty, and love towards them, as the reward of his ſufferings, but doth alſo ſtand obliged thereunto, by vertue of a commiſſion and truſt laid upon him by the father, and accepted and undertaken by him; therefore doth he mention <hi>the will of him that ſent me,</hi> as a reaſon of his fidelity in this matter. Further, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Goſpel contains an extract of the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p counſels of God, and of the eternal tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the father and the ſon, concerning loſt man, ſo far as is for our good; for he brings out, and reads in the Goſpel his very Commiſſion, and ſome Articles of the Covenant, paſt betwixt the father and him. Again, the firſt fountain and riſe of the ſalvation of any of loſt mankind, is in the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſovereign will and pleaſure of God;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65138:107"/> for here he mentions the will of him that ſent him, as the firſt original of all; from whence their giving to Chriſt, their coming and ſafety do flow. Again, theſe whoſe ſalvation the father willeth, are given over to Chriſt, in his eternal purpoſe, to be brought to him in due time; for ſo it is here held out. Again, ſuch as are given to Chriſt by the father, and do in time come to him, are put in his keeping, and he hath a care of them, not to loſe the leaſt of them; <hi>For this is the will of him that ſent me, that of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>all he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing;</hi> wherein the father doth ſo commit the truſt to him, as that he ſtill keeps them in his own hand alſo. Again, Chriſt's charge and care of theſe that are given to him, extends even to the very day of their Reſurrection, that there he may make a good account of them, when all perils and hazards are now over, and that he may not ſo much as loſe their duſt, but gather it together again, and raiſe it up in glory, to be a proof of his fidelity; for, ſaith he, <hi>I ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but raiſe it up again at the laſt day;</hi> and ſo death and diſſolution proves no loſs. Again, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. we may obſerve, That ſuch as are given to Chriſt, to be under his charge, and to participate of his benefits, are drawn to believe on him: And it is the father's will, and a part of the tranſaction betwixt him and his ſon, that faith be the way to partake of theſe benefits, and not the fulfilling of the impoſſible condition of the works of the Law; for they who are given to Chriſt, are expounded to be they who believe on him; and it is the father's will, that ſuch partake of theſe benefits here mentioned, as of the reſt of his purchaſe. Albeit mortification, holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do prepare for the poſſeſſion of theſe benefits, and do evidence a right thereunto, and the begun poſſeſſion thereof; yet it is only faith in Chriſt, that giveth the right<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 6, 7, 8.</note> and title, that ſo it may be of Grace. Again, it is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted betwixt the father and the ſon, that believers ſhall be made partakers of everlaſting life; for it is explained, that not to loſe them, <hi>verſ. 39. is that they may have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> for the further aſſurance of believers, of their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65138:107"/> eternal happineſs; it is alſo covenanted, that they ſhall have this life in preſent poſſeſſion, in the earneſt, and firſt fruits thereof; for they have everlaſting life even here, and before their raiſing up: They have everlaſting life; 1. <hi>in pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Again, Chriſt having given an earneſt-penny of ſalvation, will not ſuffer it to be loſt, by any difficulty or impediment in the way, but will carry believers through all difficulties, till he deſtroy death and the grave, and raiſe up their very duſt, that in body and ſoul, they may partake of that bliſs; and that he may make it manifeſt, that death and rotting in the grave doth not make void his intereſt, nor cauſe his affection to ceaſe. Therefore it is added, <hi>And I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Thus you ſee, that God the father did lay his commands upon his ſon, to engage in this great work of redeeming and ſaving poor ſinners ſouls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place I ſhall ſhew you, that the manner or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> quality of the tranſaction between God the father and Jeſus Chriſt, was by mutual engagements and ſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; each perſon undertaking to perform his part, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our recovery and eternal felicity; we find each perſon undertaking for himſelf by ſolemn promiſe: The father promiſeth that he will hold Chriſt's hand, and keep him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6. God the father engages himſelf to direct and aſſiſt Chriſt, and to keep him from miſcarrying; and that he will give him all neceſſary ſtrength and ability, for the execution of his mediatory office, and work wonders by him and with him, according to that word, <hi>My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hitherto worketh, and I work:</hi> and the ſon engages<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 17.</note> himſelf, that he will obey the fathers call, and not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, <hi>Iſa. 50. 5.

                  </gap>s</hi> did, but I offered my ſelf freely and readily to my father's call; there was no affliction, no oppoſition, no perſecution, no evil uſage that I met with in carrying on
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65138:108"/> the work of Redemption, that did ever ſtartle me, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me, or make me flinch or ſhrink back from that great and bleſſed work that I had undertaken: I was duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obedient to the calls &amp; commands of my father, in all things that he required of me, or ſet me about. Now the father &amp; the ſon being thus mutually engaged by promiſe one to another in honour and faithfulneſs, it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them to keep one another cloſe to the terms of the Covenant that was made between them, and accordingly they did; for God the father peremptorily ſtands upon that compleat and full ſatisfaction, that Chriſt had promiſed to give to his juſtice; and therefore, when the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came, he would not abate Jeſus Chriſt one penny, one farthing of the many ten thouſand Talents, that he<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 24.</note> was to pay down upon the nail for us; <hi>Rom. 8. 32. God ſpared not his own ſon;</hi> that is, he abated nothing of that full price that, by agreement with his father, he was to lay down for us; other fathers give their all, to ſpare and redeem their children; but the heart of God the father is ſo fully and ſtrongly ſet upon ſatisfaction, that he will not ſpare his ſon, his own ſon, his only ſon, but give him up to death, yea, to an accurſed death, that we might be<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mauritius,</hi> who died moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.</note> ſpared and ſaved for ever. I have read of a Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who choſe rather to ſpare his money, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his ſouldiers, being taken priſoners: But to redeem us God would not ſpare, no not his own ſon; becauſe no money nor treaſure would ſerve the turn, but only the blood, yea, the heart-blood of his dear ſon; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>And as God the father keeps Chriſt cloſe to the terms of the Covenant, ſo Jeſus Chriſt keeps his father cloſe to the terms of the Covenant alſo, <hi>Joh. 17. 4, 5. I have glorified thee on the earth</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his father;) <hi>I have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was:</hi> O my father, I have finiſhed the work of Redemption; but where's the wages, where's the glory, where's the reward that thou haſt promiſed me. There was nothing committed to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65138:108"/> Chriſt by the father, to be done on earth for the purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Redemption, but he did finiſh it; ſo that the debt is paid, juſtice ſatisfied, and ſin, Satan and death ſpoiled; ſo that nothing remains, but that Chriſt be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified according to the promiſe of the father to him. The ſumm of Chriſt's petition is this, that ſince he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work of Redemption, that therefore the father, according to his engagement, would advance him to the poſſeſſion of that glory that he enjoyed from all eternity. Now, for the clearing of this, we muſt conſider, that as Chriſt was from Eternity the glorious God, ſo we are not to conceive of any real change in this glory of his Godhead; as if, by his eſtate of humiliation, he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any diminution; or by his ſtate of exaltation, any real acceſſion were made to his glory, as God: But the true meaning is this, That Chriſt having (according to the paction paſt betwixt the father and him) obſcured the glory of his Godhead for a time, under the veil of the<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> form of a ſervant, and our ſinleſs infirmities, doth now expect (according to the tenour of the ſame paction) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had done his work, to be exalted and glorified, and <hi>openly declared to be the ſon of God;</hi> the veil of his eſtate<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> of humiliation, though not of our nature, being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. It is further to be conſidered, that however this eternal glory be proper to him as God, yet he prays to be glorified in his whole perſon, <hi>Glorifie me;</hi> becauſe, not only his humane nature was to be exalted to what glory finite nature was capable of, but the glory of his Godhead was to ſhine in the perſon of Chriſt, God-man, and in the man Chriſt, though without confuſion of his natures and properties. Chriſt did ſo faithfully diſcharge his truſt, and perfect the work of Redemption, as that the father was engaged by paction to glorifie him; and accordingly Chriſt, God incarnate, is exalted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the father in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and majeſty; ſo that believers may be as ſure that all things neceſſary for their Redemption are done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is ſure that Chriſt is glorified. But,</p>
            <p>In the fourth place let us ſeriouſly conſider of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65138:109"/> Articles, agreed on between the father and the ſon; let us weigh well the promiſes that God the father makes to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and the promiſes that Jeſus Chriſt makes to the father, for the bringing about our reconciliation and Redemption, that ſo we may the more clearly ſee, how greatly both the heart of the father, and the heart of the ſon is engaged in the ſalvation of poor ſinners ſouls. Now there are Seven things, which God the father promiſeth to do for Jeſus Chriſt, upon his undertaking the work of our Redemption.</p>

The Prieſtly office of Jeſus Chriſt is erected and ſet up, on<note place="margin">

                  </gap> way you may take notice that the whole body of Anti-chriſtianiſm, is but an invaſion upon the Prieſtly office of Chriſt: What is the Popiſh Maſs, (that unbloody ſacrifice) but a derogation from the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, once upon the Croſs; and ſo a derogation from his Prieſtly Office? What are all thoſe Popiſh Penances and ſatisfactions injoyned, but a derogation unto the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; and ſo unto the Prieſtly office of Chriſt? What is all their praying to Saints and Angels, but a derogation unto the interceſſion of Chriſt; and ſo unto the Prieſtly office. God deputes Chriſt to his Prieſtly office, as God and man; yet Papiſts ſay, that Chriſt is a Prieſt only in his humane nature. God ſaith to his ſon, <hi>Thou art a prieſt;</hi> yet they make many Prieſts: God makes his Son a Prieſt for ever, yet they ſubſtitute others in his room: God gave Chriſt to offer up but one ſacrifice, and that but once; but they, every day, offer up many ſacrifices in the Maſs: God gave Chriſt to offer up himſelf; but they offer up bread and wine, upon pretence that its the body and blood of Chriſt: Chriſt's ſacrifico was a bloody ſacrifice; but they ſtile theirs an unbloody ſacrifice.</note> purpoſe for the relief of poor diſtreſſed ſinners. The
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65138:111"/> work of the High Prieſt, is to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people: In the times of the Old Teſtament, the High Prieſt made an atonement for the people; in caſe any man had ſinned, he brought a ſacrifice, &amp; his ſins were laid upon the head of the ſacrifice: Once every year, the High Prieſt did enter into the holy of holies; and with the blood of the ſacrifice, did ſprinkle the Mercy-Seat, and laid the ſins of the people upon the head of the Scape-Goat, &amp; ſo made an Atonement for the people; as is clear in that, <hi>Levit. 16. 14. He ſhall take of the blood of the Bullock, and ſprinkle it with his finger, upon the Mercy-ſeat eaſtward, and before the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat ſhall he ſprinkle of the blood with his finger, ſeven times:</hi> And at <hi>verſ. 21. Aaron ſhall lye both his hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the live Goat, and confeſs over him all the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the children of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſſions, and all their ſins, putting them upon the head of the Goat; and ſhall ſend him away, by the hand of a fit man, into the wilderneſs; and ſo he ſhall make an Atonement.</hi> This was the work of the High Prieſt, in caſe any had ſinned, to make an Atonement and ſatisfaction (by the way of Type) for the ſins of the people. The main ſcope of the Apoſtle in that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. is to advance Chriſt his Prieſthood above the Levitical Prieſthood; in order to which, he premiſeth this, That <hi>thoſe prieſts were made without an oath;</hi> verſ. 20: The Apoſtle's third Argument to prove the excellency of Chriſt's Prieſtood above the Levitical, is taken from the different manner of inſtituting the one and the other: Chriſt's inſtitution was more ſolemn than the Levites; their inſtitution was without an oath, Chriſt's inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was with an oath: The Argument may be thus framed, That Prieſthood which is eſtabliſhed by an oath, is more excellent than that which is without an oath; but Chriſt's Prieſthood is with an oath, and theirs without; <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is here taken for granted, that Chriſt was moſt ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a Prieſt, even by an oath; yea, by the oath of God himſelf; which is the greateſt, and moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of inſtitution that can be. God's oath imports two things; 1. An infallible certainty of that which he ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65138:111"/> 2. A ſolemn authority and dignity conferred upon that which he inſtituted by oath. Great and weighty matters of much concernment, uſe to be eſtabliſhed by oath; hereby it appeareth, that Chriſt's Prieſthood is a matter of great moment, and of much concernment: This will appear the more evident, if we conſider the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was made Prieſt, <hi>viz.</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was the greateſt perſon that could be; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 28. therefore he is fitly called <hi>a great high prieſt,</hi> Heb. 4. 14. Or if we conſider the ends of Chriſt's Prieſthood, which were very weighty, and that in reference both to God and man: To God, for the manifeſtation of his perfect juſtice, infinite mercy, almighty power, unſearchable wiſdom, and other divine attributes, which never were, nor ever can be ſo manifeſted, as in and by Chriſt's Prieſthood: To man, that God's wrath might be averted, his favour procured, man's ſin purged, and he freed from all evil, and brought to eternal happineſs. Or if we conſider the benefits of Chriſt's Prieſthood, which are anſwerable to the foreſaid ends. Jeſus Chriſt was appointed and made by the father, <hi>The Apoſtle and High Prieſt of the Churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:</hi> Heb. 3. 1, 2. <hi>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling; conſider the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> who was faithful to him that appointed him. Chriſt had a divine call to the execution of all thoſe offices, which he ſuſtained as our Mediator; he did not run before he was ſent, he did not act without a Commiſſion and Warrant, he was lawfully conſtituted by him who had power, to undertake that great charge he hath over the Church; this we ſhall find aſſerted of all his three offices. As for his Prieſtly office, he was made a Prieſt by an immediate call and ordination from God: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. The ſcope of the Apoſtle, is to ſet out the excellency of Chriſt's Prieſthood, by comparing it with the Levitical; His Prieſthood had a concurrence of all things neceſſary to the Levitical; and it had many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies above that. Now, among other things requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> this was one, there muſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65138:112"/> be a divine regular call; this was in the Prieſthood of Chriſt; <hi>He was called of God, an high prieſt, after the order</hi>

This Prieſtly office of Chriſt is ſure, becauſe it is confirmed by God's oath (of which before) as well as his promiſe. The promiſe makes it ſure, the oath doubly ſure, irrevocable: And certainly, the Lord neither can nor will ever repent himſelf of this promiſe and oath. The Prieſthood of Chriſt is the moſt noble part of all his mediation; in the Prieſthood of Chriſt, and in that eſpecially, lies the latitude and longitude, the profundity and ſublimity of God's love towards us; and in reſpect of this eſpecially, is the whole myſtery of our Redemption by Chriſt called, <gap reason="foreign">

For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham:</hi> Chriſt aſſumed the common nature of man, and not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular perſon. The Apoſtle doth here purpoſely uſe this word ſeed, to ſhew that Chriſt came out of the<note place="margin">Gen. 46. 26. Exod. 1. 5.

               <hi>the ſeed of Abraham, the ſeed of Iſaac, the ſeed of David;</hi> This word, <hi>he took on him,</hi> as it ſetteth out the humane nature of Chriſt, ſo it gives us a hint of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for it preſuppoſeth that Chriſt was before he took on him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> He that taketh any thing on him, muſt needs be before he do ſo; is it poſſible for him that is not, to take any thing on him? Now Chriſt, in regard of his humane nature, was not before he aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that nature; therefore that former being muſt needs be in regard of his divine nature, in that reſpect he ever was, even the eternal God; being God, he took on him an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. Chriſt's Eternal Deity ſhines in this 16. verſe, and ſo does his true humanity; in that he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the ſeed of man, it is moſt evident that he was a true man; Seed is the matter of man's nature, and the very ſubſtance thereof. The ſeed of man is the root, out<note place="margin">Iſa. 11. 1. Luk. 1. 35.</note> of which Chriſt aſſumed his humane nature: The humane nature was not created of nothing, nor was it brought from heaven, but aſſumed out of the ſeed of man. The humane nature of Chriſt never had a ſubſiſtence in it ſelf.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65138:123"/> but the Son, the ſecond Perſon, for <hi>the Word was made Fleſh.</hi> There being a real diſtinction of the Perſons, that one of them is is not another; and each of them having their proper manner of ſubſiſtence, the one of them might be incarnate, and not the other; and it is the Godhead, not ſimply conſidered, but the Perſon of the Son, ſubſiſting in that Godhead, that was incarnate. And it was very convenient, that the ſecond or middle Perſon (in order of ſubſiſtence) of the bleſſed Trinity, ſhould be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler of God and man; and that <hi>he by whom all things</hi>

Oh the admirable love and wiſdom of God that ſhines in this, that the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity is ſet on work to procure our Redemption! Though reaſon could never have found out ſuch a way, yet when God hath revealed it, reaſon, though but ſhallow, can ſee a fitneſs in it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there being a neceſſity that the Saviour of man ſhould be man, and an impoſſibility that any but God ſhould ſave him; and one Perſon in the Trinity being to be incarnate, it agrees to reaſon, that the firſt Perſon in the Trinity ſhould not be the Mediator; for who ſhould ſend him? he is of none, and therefore could not be ſent: There muſt be one ſent to reconcile the enmity, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give gifts to friends; two proceeding Perſons, the Son from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son: Accordingly the ſecond Perſon, which is the Son, he is ſent upon the firſt errand, to reconcile man to God; and the third perſon, the Holy Ghoſt, he is ſent to give gifts to men ſo reconciled; ſo as to reaſon, it is ſuitable, and a very great congruity; that God, having made all things by his Son, ſhould now repair all things by his Son; that he that was the middle Perſon in the Trinity, ſhould become the Mediator between God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and man; that he that was <hi>the expreſs Image of the Father's Perſon,</hi> ſhould reſtore the Image of God, defaced in man by his ſins. Ah Chriſtians, how well does it become you
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65138:124"/> to loſe your ſelves in the admiration of the wiſdom of God, in the contrivance of the work of our Redemption! For the Son of God to take on him the nature of man, with all the eſſential properties thereof, and all the ſinleſs infirmities and frailties thereof, is a wonder that may well take up our thoughts to all Eternity. And Chriſt took the infirmities of our nature, as well as the nature it ſelf: To ſhew the truth of his Humanity; he had a nature that could hunger and thirſt even as ours do, and to ſanctifie them to us; and that ſo he might ſympathize with us, <hi>as a merciful and faithful High Prieſt;</hi> and that we might<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16, 17, 18. cap. 4. 15, 16.</note> confide the more in him, and have acce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh, what an honour has Jeſus Chriſt put upon fallen man, by taking the nature of man on him! What is ſo near and dear to us as our own nature? and lo, our nature is highly preferred by Jeſus Chriſt, to a Union in the Godhead; Chriſt now ſits in heaven with<note place="margin">Act. 1. 9, 10, 11.</note> our nature, and the ſame fleſh that we have upon us, only glorified. It is that which all the world cannot give a ſufficient reaſon, why the ſame word in the Hebrew, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhar,</hi> ſhould ſignifie both <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Good Tidings;</hi> Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will give you a reaſon, though Grammar cannot; Chriſt's taking of fleſh upon him, was good tidings to all the whole world, therefore no wonder if one word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie both. Abundance of comfort may be taken from hence to poor ſouls, when they think God hath forgotten them, to conſider, is it likely that Chriſt who is Man, ſhould forget man, now he is at the right hand of the Father, cloathed in that nature that we have; when we are troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think it is impoſſible God and man ſhould ever be reconciled, let us conſider that God and man did meet in Chriſt, therefore it is poſſible we may meet, what hath been may be again; the two natures met in Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65138:124"/> God may be reconciled to man; yea, they therefore met, that God might be reconciled to man; he was made <hi>Immanuel, God with us,</hi> that he might bring God and us together; when a man is troubled to think of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptious of his nature, that is ſo full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As the Elect are committed to Chriſt's charge, to give an account of them; ſo alſo is the Father engaged for their converſion, and for their preſervation being converted: As being not only his own,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 37.

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, the favour of God, the heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance could never have been obtained, but by the proci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of the Son of God. The innocent Lamb of God was ſlain, in typical prefigurations, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world; and ſlain in real performance, in the fulneſs of time, or elſe fallen man had layen under guilt and wrath for ever: The heart of Jeſus Chriſt was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet upon all thoſe that his Father had given him, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65138:127"/> he was fully reſolved to ſecure them from Hell and the Curſe, whatever it coſt him; and ſeeing no price would ſatisfie his Father's Juſtice below his Blood, he lays down his life at his Father's feet, according to the Covenant and Agreement of old, that had paſt between his Father and himſelf. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt was very free, ready, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> willing and careful to make good all the Articles of the Covenant on his ſide, and to diſcharge all the works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed<note place="margin">Joh. 12. 49, 50. cap. 17. 6.</note> on for the Redemption and Salvation of the Elect: <hi>Joh. 17. 4.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65138:128"/> Chriſt is inferiour to God, and is capable of advancement; ſo alſo is the perſon conſiſting of a Divine and Humane Nature. Chriſt, as the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon of the ſacred Trinity, is, in regard of his Deity, no whit inferiour to his Father, but every way equal; yet he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed our nature, and became a Mediator betwixt God &amp; man; he humbled himſelf, and made himſelf inferiour to his Father; his Father therefore hath highly exalted him,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9.</note> and ſet him down on his right hand. If Chriſt had not<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 20.</note> expiated our ſins, and compleated the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, he could never have ſat down on the right hand of God; <hi>Heb. 10. 12. But this man, after he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſat down on the right hand of God.</hi> This verſe is added in oppoſition to the former, as is evident by the firſt Particle (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) But in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe it was proved, that the Sacrifices which were offered under the Law, could not take away ſins: This verſe proveth, that there is a Sacrifice, which hath done that that they could not do. The Argument is taken from that Prieſt's ceaſing to offer any more Sacrifices, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had offered one; whereby is implyed, that there needed no other, becauſe that one had done it to the full; ſin was taken away by Chriſt's Sacrifice, for thereby a Ranſom was paid, and ſatisfaction made to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for man's ſin, and thereupon ſin taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away: Now, ſin being taken away, <hi>Chriſt ſits down on the right hand of his Father.</hi> Look, as the humiliation of Chriſt was manifeſted in offering a Sacrifice, ſo his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in ſitting at God's right hand, was manifeſted, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had offered that ſacrifice. This phraſe, <hi>Set down,</hi> is a note of <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>authority;</hi> and this dignity and Authority is amplified by the place where he is ſaid to ſit down, <hi>viz. on the right hand of God;</hi> and this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity is much illuſtrated by the continuance thereof, which is without date; <hi>For ever ſat down on the right hand of God.</hi> It is an Eclipſe of the luſtre of any glory, to have a date and a period: The very thought that ſuch a glory ſhall one day ceaſe, will caſt a damp upon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65138:128"/> the Spirit of him that enjoys that Glory: Chriſt's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſitting at the right hand of his Father, is a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he has finiſhed and compleated the work of our Redemption. Chriſt could never have gone to his Father, nor never have ſet down at the right hand of his Father, if he had not firſt fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and fully acquitted us of all our iniquities; <hi>Joh. 16. 10. Of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father.</hi> The ſtrength of the Argument lies in this, Chriſt took upon him to be our Surety, and he muſt acquit us of all our ſins, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Father's Juſtice, before he can go to his Father, and be accepted of his Father, and ſit down on the right hand of his Father: If God had not been fully ſatisfied, or if any part of Righteouſneſs had been to be fulfilled, Chriſt ſhould have been ſtill in the grave, and not gone to heaven; his very going to his Father, argues all is done, all is finiſhed and compleated. But</p>

It is a part of Chriſt's joy, that we ſhould be where he is; Chriſt will not be happy alone, as a tender father, he can enjoy nothing, if his children may not have part with him. The greateſt part of our happineſs that we ſhall have in heaven, lies in this, that then we ſhall be with Chriſt, and have immediate communion with him. Oh ſirs! the great end of our being in heaven, is to behold and enjoy the glory of Chriſt: Chriſt is very deſirous, and much taken up with his peoples fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; ſo that before he removes his bodily preſence from them, his heart is upon meeting and fellowſhip again, as here we ſee in his prayer before his departure; and this he makes evident from day to day, in that, until that time of meeting come, two or three are not gathered in his name, but he is in the midſt of them; to eye their behaviour, to<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> hear their ſuits, to guide their way, to to protect their perſons, to chear their ſpirits, and to delight in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: He delights to <hi>walk in the midſt of the ſeven golden</hi>

Now, ſhall men that are ſtrangers to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption, ſuffer ſuch hard and great things for their luſts, for very vanity? and will not you, who are acquainted with the Covenant of Redemption, and who are intereſted in the Covenant of Redemption, be ready and willing to ſuffer any thing for that Jeſus, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant of Redemption, has ſuffered ſuch dreadful things for you, and merited ſuch glorious things for you? But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From this Covenant of Redemption, as we have opened it, you may ſee what infinite cauſe we have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to be ſwallowed up in the admiration of the Father's love in entring into this Covenant, and in making good all the Articles of this Covenant on his ſide: When man was fallen from his primitive purity and glory, from his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note place="margin">God ſo loved his Son, that he gave him all the world for his poſſeſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. But he ſo loved the world, that he gave Son and all for its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
               </note> and happineſs, from his freedom and liberty, into a moſt woful gulf of ſin and miſery; when Angels and men were all at a loſs, and knew no way or means, whereby fallen man might be raiſed, reſtored and ſaved; that then God ſhould firſtly and freely propoſe this Covenant, and enter into this Covenant, that miſerable man might be ſaved from wrath to come; and raiſed and ſettled in a more ſafe, high and happy eſtate than that was, from which he was fallen in <hi>Adam:</hi> Oh, what wonderful, what amazing love is this! <hi>Abraham</hi> manifeſted a great deal of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65138:133"/> love to God, in offering up of his only <hi>Iſaac;</hi> but God<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 12.</note> has ſhewed far greater love to poor ſinners, in making his only Son an offering for their ſins; for 1. God loved Chriſt with a more tranſcendent love, than <hi>Abraham</hi> could<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 18. Heb. 10. 10, 12.</note> love <hi>Iſaac:</hi> 2. God was not bound by the commandment of a ſuperiour to do it, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was: 3. God freely and voluntarily did it, which <hi>Abraham</hi> would never have done without a commandment: 4. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the manner of holy Sacrifices, but Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an ignominious death, after the manner of Thieves: 5. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was all along in the hands of a tender Father, but Chriſt was all along in the hands of barbarous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: 6. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was offered but in ſhew, but Chriſt was offered indeed and in very good earneſt: Is not this an exceſs, yea, a miracle of love? 'Tis good to be always a muſing upon this love, and delighting our ſelves in this love. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, From this Covenant of Redemption, as we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> have opened it, you may ſee what ſignal cauſe we have to be deeply affected with the love of Jeſus Chriſt, who roundly and readily falls in with this Covenant, and who has faithfully performed all the Articles of this Covenant; had not Jeſus Chriſt kept touch with his Father as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Article of the Covenant of Redemption he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſaved us, nor have ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, nor have been admitted into heaven. That Jeſus Chriſt might make full ſatisfaction for all our ſins, <hi>He was made a curſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3 13.</note> 
               <hi>for us, whereby he hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law:</hi> All his ſufferings were for us. All that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of God by man, is mercy and truth; mercy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our miſery, truth in reference to God's promiſes: That which moved Chriſt to engage himſelf as a Surety for us, was his reſpect to God and man: To God, for the honour of his Name; neither the mercy, nor the truth, nor the juſtice of God had been ſo conſpicuouſly manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if Jeſus Chriſt had not been our Surety: To man, and that to help us in our ſuccourleſs and deſperate eſtate. No creature either would or could diſcharge that debt,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65138:134"/> wherein man ſtood obliged to the juſtice of God. This is a mighty evidence of the endleſs love of Chriſt, this is an evidence of the endleſs and matchleſs love of Chriſt: We count it a great evidence of love, for a friend to be ſurety for us, when we intend no damage to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; but if a man be ſurety for that, which he knoweth the principal debtor is not able to pay, and thereupon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to pay it himſelf; this we look upon as an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary evidence of love: But what amazing love, what matchleſs love is this, for a man to engage his perſon and life for his friend, when as <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life;</hi> and yet, according to the Covenant of Redemption, Jeſus Chriſt has done all this and much more for us, as is evident, if you will but caſt your eye back upon the Articles of the Covenant, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Scriptures in the Margin.

But now, if the dignity of Chriſt's perſon and our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if the greatneſs of the debt and kind of payment, and if the benefit which we reap thereby be duly weighed, we ſhall find theſe evidences of love to come as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the love of Chriſt, as the light of a candle cometh ſhort of the light of the Sun. Chriſt's Suretiſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant of Redemption is and ought to be a prop of props to our faith: It is as ſure a ground of confidence that all is well, and ſhall be for ever well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, as any the Scriptures does afford; by vertue hereof, we have a right to appeal to God's Juſtice, for this Surety hath made ful ſatisfaction; and to exact a debt which is fully ſatisfied, is a point of injuſtice.

The ſumm of the 21. verſe is, That the Creature ſhall not be always ſubject to vanity, but ſhall have a manumiſſion from bondage; of the which deliverance, three things are declared; Firſt, who, the Creature, that is, <hi>The World:</hi> Secondly, From what, from <hi>Corruption,</hi> which is a bondage: Thirdly, Into what eſtate, into <hi>the glorious liberty of the ſons of God.</hi> Some here note, the time of the deliverance of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, namely, when the children of God ſhall be wholly ſet free; for though they have here a freedom unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneeſs, from the bondage of ſin, yet they have not a freedom of glory, which is from the bondage of miſery: But others take it for the ſtate it ſelf which ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not the ſame with the children of God, but propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned according to its kind with them; for it is moſt ſuitable to the liberty of the faithful, that as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, ſo alſo ſhould their habitation, And as, when a Noble man mourneth, his ſervants are all clad in black; ſo it is for the greater glory of man, that the Creatures, his ſervants, ſhould in their kind, partake of his glory. And whereas ſome ſay, that it is deliverance enough for the creature, if it ceaſe to ſerve man, and have an end of vanity, by annihilation: I affirm, it is not enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this 21. verſe notes, not only ſuch deliverance, but alſo a further eſtate which it ſhall have after ſuch deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; namely, to communicate in ſome degree, with the children of God in glory. Certainly, the Creatures in their kind and manner, ſhall be made partakers of a far
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65138:136"/> better eſtate, than they had while the world endured; becauſe that God ſhall fully and wholly reſtore the world, being fallen into corruption through the tranſgreſſion and ſin of Man-kind.

            <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, There is a Book of Life, <hi>Rev. 20. 12. And another book was opened, which is the book of life:</hi> the Book of Life, is the Book of all thoſe that were elected and redeemed to life, through Chriſt Jeſus. This Book of Life containeth a Regiſter of ſuch particular perſons, in whoſe Salvation, God from all Eternity, determined to have his mercy glorified; and for whom Chriſt merited Faith; Repentance, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65138:141"/> perſeverance, that they ſhould repent, believe, and be finally ſaved. <hi>The book of life ſhall be opened;</hi> that is to ſay, the Decrees of God will be then publiſhed and made known, which now are ſealed up in his breaſt, and locked up in his Archives. Then it will be ſeen who are appointed to life, for the glorifying of God's free, rich and Soveraign Grace; and whom he purpoſed to leave in their ſins, and to periſh for ever, for the exaltation of his Juſtice. 'Tis called <hi>A Book of Life;</hi> not that God hath need of a Book, but to note the certainty of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>viz.</hi> that God knows all and every of the Elect, even as men know a thing which, for memory's ſake, they ſet down in writing. This Book of Life ſhall be opened in the great day, becauſe then it ſhall appear, who were Elect, who Reprobates; who truly believed in Chriſt, who not; who <hi>worſhipped God in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> and who not; who walked with God as <hi>Noah,</hi> and who not, who ſet up God as the object of their fear; who not; <hi>who followed the Lamb whither ever he went,</hi> and who not; who were ſincere, and who not; who preferred Chriſt above ten thouſand worlds, and who preferred <hi>Barrabas</hi> before Jeſus; and their Farms, and their Oxen, and their<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 32.</note> Swine, yea, their very Luſts, before a Saviour, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;<note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 4, 6.</note> who are Sheep, and who are Goats; who are Sons, and who are Slaves; who have mourned for their own ſins and the ſins of the time, and who they are that have made a ſport of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of this Book of Life, you read often in Scripture; <hi>Phil. 4. 3. And I intreat thee alſo, true yoke-fellow, help thoſe women which laboured with me in the Goſpel, with Clement alſo, and with other my fellow-labourers, whoſe names are in the book of life. Vorſtius</hi> thinks it a ſpeech taken from the cuſtome of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or Cities, in which the choſen Souldiers or Citizens, are by name written in a certain Book or Roll. This Book or Roll is called here <hi>The Book of Life,</hi> becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are written all the Elect, who are ordained to Eternal Life, <hi>Rev. 3. 5. He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be

The names of the Elect are written in the Book of Life; they do not obtain Salvation by chance, but were elected of God to life and happineſs, before the Foundation of the World. Now, their names being once written in the Book of Life, they ſhall never, never be blotted out of that Book. In the Book of Predeſtination, there is not one blot to be found; the Salvation of the Elect, is moſt ſure and certain; <hi>Rev. 13. 8. And all that dwell on the earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe names are not written in the book of life, of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</hi> The names of the Elect are ſaid to be written in the Book of Life, by an uſual Metaphor, for we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly write down the names of ſuch as are dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that we may continually remember them: So God having, in his Eternal Council, elected ſome to Salvation, hath written their names in the Book of Life; as our Saviour tells us, <hi>Rejoyce, becauſe your</hi>
